9780374280253,Two Murders In My Double Life,['Josef Skvorecky'],"<p>""A complex bio-mystery about the Kafkaesque machinations of politics."" (Aritha van Herk, <i>The Globe and Mail</i>)</p>
<p>In Josef Skvorecký's first novel written in English, the narrator lives in two worlds: the exile world of post-Communist Czechoslovakia, where old feuds, treacherous betrayals, and friendships that have lasted through wars, occupations, and revolutions survive; and the fatuously self-congratulatory comfortable world of a Canadian university, in which grave attention is given to matters such as whether a certain male professor has left his office door open wide enough while interviewing a female student.</p>
<p>Murder suddenly intrudes upon both of these worlds. One features a young female sleuth, a college beauty queen, professional jealousies, and a neat conclusion. The other is a tragedy caused by evil social forces, in which a web of lies works insidiously to entangle Sidonia, who is a publisher of suppressed books and the narrator's wife.</p>
<p>A brilliantly stylish tour de force in which the bright, sarcastic comedy of one tale sharply contrasts with the dark, elegiac bitterness of the other, <i>Two Murders in My Double Life</i> confirms Skvorecký's reputation as one of our most versatile, engaging, and compassionate writers.</p>
<p>Josef Skvorecký is the author of <i>The Cowards</i>, <i>The Bass Saxophone</i>, <i>The Engineer of Human Souls</i>, and <i>Dvorak in Love</i>, among other works. He is the winner of Canada's Governor General's Award. He and his wife, Zdena, divide their time between Toronto and Venice, Florida.</p>"

He has come to bury the corrupt, charismatic head of the family sugar dynasty: his estranged father, Jesus. To Caracera's chagrin and pleasure, he is now viewed by his countrymen as the representative American; a local tabloid even refers to him as a General Douglas MacArthur look-alike. And when his father's will is read, Caracera is stunned to discover that he has been left half a million dollars.</p>
<p>Unable to live with this burdensome inheritance, he decides to give his money away. But who among the millions of needy Filipinos is he to focus on?</p>
<p>Traversing high and low life, societies rank and respectable, and with a cast of characters that includes a slum-dwelling boy hustler, a middle-aged American pederast, a rising Filipino tennis player, a calculating society matron, and a Peace Corps worker turned trophy wife, <i>The Disinherited</i> is an incisive and illuminating exploration of the impulse to do good in the world and the paradoxical harm brought on by generosity.</p>"

<p>When Kathleen Hirsch first moved to Jamaica Plain, an unassuming neighborhood in Boston, she was looking for a place to belong, to set down roots. Was it possible, she wondered, to find community in a contemporary city? A Home in the Heart of a City is Hirsch's exuberant and hopeful response. We follow her as she meets extraordinary individuals, including the protector of a local park, an urban gardener, and a corporate lawyer turned community advocate. They become her guides, showing that living well in community is as much about the personal choices we make to work, play, and associate in certain ways as it is about the grassroots institutions we build to foster community life.</p>"

He provided unvarnished assessments of cabinet members, congressmen, and foreign leaders; he narrated the progress of secret negotiations such as those that led to the Camp David Accords; he recorded his thoughts, impressions, delights, and frustrations. When his four-year term came to an end in early 1981, the diary amounted to more than five thousand pages. This extraordinary document has never been made public---until now."" ""By selecting the most illuminating and relevant entries, Carter has provided us with an astonishingly intimate view of his presidency. Day by day, we see his forceful advocacy for sustainable energy, nuclear containment, human rights, and peace in the Middle East. We witness his interactions with such complex personalities as Teddy Kennedy, Henry Kissinger, Joe Biden, Anwar Sadat, and Menachem Begin. We get the inside story of his so-called ""malaise speech,"" his bruising battle for the 1980 Democratic nomination, and his relentless efforts to resolve the Iranian hostage crisis. Remarkably, we also get Carter's retrospective comments on these topics and more: thirty years after the fact, he has annotated the diary with candid reflections on the people and events that shaped his presidency, and on the many lessons he learned."" Carter is now widely seen as one of the truly wise men of our time. Offering an unprecedented look at both the man and his tenure, this fascinating book will stand as a unique contribution to the history of the American presidency.</p>"

<p>Less than two years later, Jay had killed himself.</p>
<p>On Valentine’s Day.</p>
<p><i>Happy Now?</i> follows Claire’s chaotic and often tragicomic journey through the weeks that follow her husband’s suicide.

9780374281526,"The Invisible Cure: Africa, The West, And The Fight Against Aids",['Helen Epstein'],"<p>In 1993, Helen Epstein, a scientist working with a biotechnology company searching for an AIDS vaccine, moved to Uganda, where she witnessed firsthand the suffering caused by the epidemic. Now, in her unsparing and illuminating account of this global disease, she describes how international health experts, governments, and ordinary Africans have struggled to understand the rapid and devastating spread of the disease in Africa, and traces the changes wrought by new medical developments and emerging political realities. It is an account of scientific discovery and intrigue with implications far beyond the fight against one tragic disease.</p>
<p>The AIDS epidemic is partly a consequence of the rapid transition of African societies from an agrarian past to an impoverished present. Millions of African people have yet to find a place in an increasingly globalized world, and their poverty and social dislocation have generated an earthquake in gender relations that deeply affects the spread of HIV. But Epstein argues that there are solutions to this crisis, and some of the most effective ones may be simpler than many people assume.</p>
<p>Written with conviction, knowledge, and insight, <i>Why Don't They</i> <i>Listen?</i> will change how we think about the worst health crisis of the past century, and our strategies for improving global public health.</p>"

The august company in which <i>The Atlantic</i> put Frazier gives an idea of where on the literary spectrum his humorous pieces lie.

<p>John Kenneth Galbraith’s books—among them <i>The Affluent Society</i> and <i>American Capitalism</i>—are famous for good reason. Written by a scholar renowned for energetic political engagement and irrepressible wit, they are models of provocative good sense that warn prophetically of the dangers of deregulated markets, war in Asia, corporate greed, and stock-market bubbles. Galbraith’s work has also deeply—and controversially—influenced his own profession, and in Richard Parker’s hands his biography becomes a vital reinterpretation of American economics and public policy.</p>
<p>Born and raised on a small Canadian farm, Galbraith began teaching at Harvard during the Depression. He was FDR’s “price czar” during the war and then a senior editor of <i>Fortune</i> before returning to Harvard and to fame as a bestselling writer. Parker shows how, from his early championing of Keynes to his acerbic analysis of America’s “private wealth and public squalor,” Galbraith regularly challenged prevailing theories and policies. And his account of Galbraith’s remarkable friendship with John F. Kennedy, whom he served as a close advisor while ambassador to India, is especially relevant for its analysis of the intense, dynamic debates that economists and politicians can have over how America should manage its wealth and power. This masterful chronicle gives color, depth, and meaning to the record of an extraordinary life.</p>"

To come up with politically correct sexual fantasies for women. No more lovesick simpering, no more masochistic daydreams! Women are going to learn to be turned on by healthier, more dignified fantasies — just as soon as Lisa can come up with some. And if you think that sounds like a fun assignment, why don't you try it.

<p>Fortunately, she has her trusty assistant, Justin. He's about to graduate from the Revolution's men's reeducation program, and he's willing to do whatever it takes to make this project a success. Working in the Ministry for all of these very serious ladies can wear a guy out, but Justin keeps himself entertained with a private project of his own: to investigate whether, contrary to appearances, liberated women actually do have a sense of humor.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, not all men are pleased with this kinder, gentler world. Harmony, a secret men's movement, is planning a violent uprising to put women back in their place.

<p><i>Split Estate</i> opens with devastating scenes of a family at a horrific juncture: the wife of Arthur King and mother of his two teenage children, Celia and Cam, has recently committed suicide, jumping out the window of their New York apartment.</p>
<p>Charlotte Bacon's luminous new novel tracks the King family as it struggles to survive in the months that follow. Arthur, an attractive lawyer who has always been edgy about city dwelling, decides they must move back to his home state of Wyoming for the summer, where his mother, Lucy, welcomes her orphaned grandchildren and her wounded son to her much loved but diminished ranch. From the perspective of each protagonist in turn, we watch shy Celia and handsome Cam, distraught Arthur and brave Lucy face themselves and their future in a Wyoming that is beautiful and consoling, yet beset by new threats of destruction.</p>
<p>A split estate is a form of real property in which the mineral rights have been split off from the other land uses to which the owner is entitled. This has transformed the landscape the Kings love and jeopardized Lucy's independence. In truth, the Kings' very lives have become split estates—for Celia, on the brink of adolescence; for Cam, approaching independent adulthood; for Arthur, divided between the West and New York. <i>Split Estate</i> is a heartrending depiction of an American family sturggling to deal with irrevocable damage to their lives and surroundings.</p>"

<br>
Anna Singer, a charmingly independent young New Yorker, feels derailed after losing her father to a car accident and her husband to a younger woman. She books a trip to India, hoping that there she will be able to put her grief into perspective. Though this is her first visit, India has always tantalized her: her English mother, Rose, was raised in Calcutta during the twilight of the British Raj, but seldom spoke of her childhood. Then, as Anna departs, Rose gives her a manuscript in which she has recorded her Indian memories--growing up with a Hindu ayah and a widower father, torn between two cultures and belonging completely to neither. Anna's sense of how she fits into the world is unexpectedly challenged by the daunting complexity of modern India, but even greater surprises are in store when she turns the pages of her mother's memoir. <br>
<br>
<i>There is Room for You</i> brilliantly traces the experience of India from the dual perspectives of Anna, who flees to the country, and Rose, who fled from it.

He evokes Henry McIlhenny, an extravagant, generous heir who devoted himself to his collection of great nineteenth-century French paintings, to pleasure, and to the entertainment of his friends in a Jamesian milieu that has since disappeared; he recalls Isabel Rawsthorne, the dissipated and alcoholic beauty whose dour paintings were unremarkable next to the edgy portraits that Francis Bacon and Alberto Giacometti made of her; he describes Peggy Guggenheim's Venice home, where he got to know the great collector and promoter of modern art in the shrine she had built to her passion. Lord also traces the fates of Sonia Orwell and Peter Watson, supporters of Cyril Connolly's historic literary review, Horizon, and Ethel Bliss Platt, whose home in Englewood, New Jersey, was resplendent with Italian art but who probably derived even more pleasure from her unconventional garden - a meadow of wildflowers. Lord depicts these cultured, privileged, and art-filled lives with a deft touch, and from a rare perspective: that of friend and confidant."
9780374281991,"Positively 4th Street The Lives And Times Of Joan Baez,bob Dylan,mimi Baez Farina And Richard Farina",['David Hajdu'],"<p>When twenty-five-year-old Bob Dylan wrecked his motorcycle near Woodstock in 1966 and dropped out of the public eye, he was already recognized as a genius, a youth idol with an acid wit and a barbwire throat; and Greenwich Village, where he first made his mark, was unquestionably the center of youth culture.</p>
<p>In <i>Positively 4th Street</i>, David Hajdu recounts the emergence of folk music from cult practice to popular and enduring art form as the story of a colorful foursome: not only Dylan but also his part-time lover Joan Baez — the first voice of the new generation; her sister Mimi — beautiful, haunted, and an artist in her own right; and Mimi's husband, Richard Fariña, a comic novelist (<i>Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up to Me</i>) who invented the worldly-wise bohemian persona that Dylan adopted — some say stole — and made his own.</p>
<p>A national bestseller in hardcover, acclaimed as ""one of the best books about music in America"" (Jonathan Yardley, <i>The Washington Post</i>), <i>Positively 4th Street</i> is that rare book with a new story to tell about the 1960s — about how the decade and all that it is now associated with were created in a fit of collective inspiration, with an energy and creativity that David Hajdu has captured on the page as if for the first time.</p>"

<br>
Tango pirate, gigolo, powder puff, Adonis—all have been used to describe the silent-film icon known as Rudolph Valentino. From his early days as a taxi dancer in New York City to his near apotheosis as the ultimate Hollywood heartthrob, Rudolph Valentino (often to his distress) occupied a space squarely at the center of controversy. In this thoughtful retelling of Valentino’s short and tragic life—the first fully documented biography of the star—Emily W. Leider looks at the Great Lover’s life and legacy, and explores the events and issues that made him emblematic of the Jazz Age. Valentino’s androgynous sexuality was a lightning rod for fiery and contradictory impulses that ran the gamut from swooning adoration to lashing resentment. He was reviled in the press for being too feminine for a man; yet he also brought to the screen the alluring, savage lover who embodied women’s darker, forbidden sexual fantasies.<br>
<br>
In tandem, Leider explores notions of the outsider in American culture as represented by Valentino’s experience as an immigrant who became a celebrity. As the silver screen’s first dark-skinned romantic hero, Valentino helped to redefine and broaden American masculine ideals, ultimately coming to represent a graceful masculinity that trumped the deeply ingrained status quo of how a man could look and act.<br>"

9780374283094,The Venus Fixers: The Remarkable Story Of The Allied Soldiers Who Saved Italy's Art During World War Ii,"['Brey, Ilaria Dagnini , 1955-']","<p>In 1943, with the world convulsed by war and a Fascist defeat in Europe far from certain, a few visionaries—civilians and soldiers alike—saw past questions of life and death to realize that victory wasn’t the only thing at stake. So was the priceless cultural heritage of thousands of years.</p>
<p>In the midst of the conflict, the Allied Forces appointed the monuments officers—a motley group of art historians, curators, architects, and artists—to ensure that the great masterworks of European art and architecture were not looted or bombed into oblivion. The journalist Ilaria Dagnini Brey focuses her spellbinding account on the monuments officers of Italy, quickly dubbed “the Venus Fixers” by bemused troops.</p>
<p>Working on the front lines in conditions of great deprivation and danger, these unlikely soldiers stripped the great galleries of their incomparable holdings and sent them into safety by any means they could; when trucks could not be requisitioned or “borrowed,” a Tiepolo altarpiece might make its midnight journey across the countryside balanced in the front basket of a bicycle. They blocked a Nazi convoy of two hundred stolen paintings—including <i>Danae</i>, Titian’s voluptuous masterpiece, an intended birthday present for Hermann Göring.They worked with skeptical army strategists to make sure air raids didn’t take out the heart of an ancient city, and patched up Renaissance palazzi and ancient churches whose lead roofs were sometimes melted away by the savagery of the attacks, exposing their frescoed interiors to the harsh Tuscan winters and blistering summers. Sometimes they failed. But to an astonishing degree, they succeeded, and anyone who marvels at Italy’s artistic riches today is witnessing their handiwork.</p>
<p>In the course of her research, Brey gained unprecedented access to private archives and primary sources, and the result is a book at once thorough and grandly entertaining—a revelatory take on a little-known chapter of World War II history. <i>The Venus Fixers</i> is an adventure story with the gorgeous tints of a Botticelli landscape as its backdrop.</p>"

How was this possible? The British administration in India took pride in its efficiency and broad-mindedness, its devotion to duty and sense of imperial grandeur, but it has become fashionable to deprecate the empire for its arrogance and ignorance. In this balanced, witty, and multifaceted history, David Gilmour goes far to explain the paradoxes of the ""Anglo-Indians,"" showing us what they hoped to achieve and what sort of society they thought they were helping to build."

<p>In April 1903, Diamante, age twelve, and Vita, age nine, are sent by their poor families in southern Italy to make a life for themselves in America. Theirs is an unforgettable love story, a riveting tale of immigrant survival and hope that takes them from the crime-ridden tenements of Little Italy to the brutal rail yards of the Midwest, on paths that cross with the Black Hand, Caruso, and Chaplin. It is a story that reaches across decades, to the son of Vita, who would travel as far as Italy to find his roots and the man who could have been his father.</p>
<p>In <i>Vita,</i> the author, Melania G. Mazzucco, also tells her own story of how she found Diamante and Vita in old photographs, documents, ship manifests, and the fading memories of her relatives, and from these fragments of the past imagined this gripping epic fiction of her family's history.</p>"

But while Balfour’s father was the child of a bank clerk and a schoolteacher and was born in a modest apartment in Kirkcaldy, Scotland, the game he came to love had an altogether more distinguished lineage.<br>
<i>Vulnerable in Hearts</i> chronicles the eight decades of Balfour’s father’s life and the same period in the history and development of bridge, a game that has enticed players from Winston Churchill and Dwight Eisenhower to Bill Gates and Clint Eastwood. First taught the game as a child by his mildly eccentric father, Balfour is drawn to bridge as a means to try to understand him, but soon discovers the global empire of the game itself. As the narrative moves from the bridge clubs of Moscow to the World Bridge Olympiad in Istanbul, Balfour explores the complex relationships of bridge and history, rules and empire, father and son.<br>
Part memoir, part history, part game, <i>Vulnerable in Hearts</i> is a wryly entertaining account of how we communicate with one another, why we play games, and how we love."
9780374285814,"Walkable City: How Downtown Can Save America, One Step At A Time","['Speck, Jeff.']","<p>Jeff Speck has dedicated his career to determining what makes cities thrive. And he has boiled it down to one key factor: walkability.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The very idea of a modern metropolis evokes visions of bustling sidewalks, vital mass transit, and a vibrant, pedestrian-friendly urban core. But in the typical American city, the car is still king, and downtown is a place that’s easy to drive to but often not worth arriving at.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Making walkability happen is relatively easy and cheap; seeing exactly what needs to be done is the trick. In this essential new book, Speck reveals the invisible workings of the city, how simple decisions have cascading effects, and how we can all make the right choices for our communities.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bursting with sharp observations and real-world examples, giving key insight into what urban planners actually do and how places can and do change, <i>Walkable City</i> lays out a practical, necessary, and eminently achievable vision of how to make our normal American cities great again.</p>"

9780374286972,We Wish To Inform You That Tomorrow We Will Be Killed With Our Families: Stories From Rwanda,['Philip Gourevitch'],"An unforgettable firsthand account of a people's response to genocide and what it tells us about humanity.<br>
<br>
This remarkable debut book chronicles what has happened in Rwanda and neighboring states since 1994, when the Rwandan government called on everyone in the Hutu majority to murder everyone in the Tutsi minority. Though the killing was low-tech--largely by machete--it was carried out at shocking speed: some 800,000 people were exterminated in a hundred days. A Tutsi pastor, in a letter to his church president, a Hutu, used the chilling phrase that gives Philip Gourevitch his title.<br>
<br>
With keen dramatic intensity, Gourevitch frames the genesis and horror of Rwanda's ""genocidal logic"" in the anguish of its aftermath: the mass displacements, the temptations of revenge and the quest for justice, the impossibly crowded prisons and refugee camps. Through intimate portraits of Rwandans in all walks of life, he focuses on the psychological and political challenges of survival and on how the new leaders of postcolonial Africa went to war in the Congo when resurgent genocidal forces threatened to overrun central Africa.<br>
<br>
Can a country composed largely of perpetrators and victims create a cohesive national society? This moving contribution to the literature of witness tells us much about the struggle everywhere to forge sane, habitable political orders, and about the stubbornness of the human spirit in a world of extremity.<br>


                        <p>Philip Gourevitch was awarded the New York Public Library's 1999 Helen Bernstein Book Award for Excellence in Journalism.

Woodholme is his poignant memoir about growing up haunted by this traumatic event, and how he eventually overcame the reality of their loss. A troublemaker in school who nearly ended up in jail, DeWayne found a home among the black caddies at an all-white Jewish country club in suburban Baltimore - Woodholme - an oasis from the strife of the civil rights era and his own problem-plagued life. The encounters he had there helped him to accept responsibility as an unwed seventeen-year-old father, and finally to come to terms with the death of his parents. Gracefully written and wryly humorous, Woodholme is an evocative portrait of growing up black in the 1960s, a sensitive exploration of paternalism and paternity, and a deeply moving story of self-discovery."

<p>Since his first poetry collection, <i>Lies</i>, C. K. Williams has nurtured an incomparable reputation—as a deeply moral poet, a writer of profound emotion, and a teller of compelling stories. In <i>Writers&nbsp;Writing Dying</i>, he retains the essential parts of his poetic identity (his candor, the drama of his verses, the social conscience of his themes) while slyly reinventing himself, recasting his voice, and in many poems examining the personal&nbsp;(sexual desire, the hubris of youth, the looming specter of death) more bluntly and bravely than ever. In “Prose,” he confronts his nineteen-year-old self, who despairs of writing poetry, with the question “How could anyone know this little?”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a poem of meditation, “The Day Continues Lovely,” he radically expands the scale of his attention: “Meanwhile cosmos roars on with so many voices we can’t hear ourselves think.&nbsp;Galaxy on.&nbsp;Galaxy off.&nbsp;Universe on, but another just behind this one . . .”&nbsp;Even the poet’s own purpose is questioned; in “Draft 23” he asks, “Between scribble and slash—are we trying to change the world by changing the words?”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With this wildly vibrant collection—by turns funny, moving, and surprising—Williams proves once again that he has, in Michael Hofmann’s words, “as much scope and truthfulness as any American poet since Lowell and Berryman.”</p>"

At the same time, he spent most of his career surrounded by controversy and ridicule--over his affairs with white film stars, his 1960 marriage to Swedish actress May Britt, his conversion to Judaism, his closeness to the Kennedys (and later Richard Nixon), and his problems with alcohol and drugs.When Davis published his first memoir, <i>Yes, I Can</i>, in 1965, it was a critical and popular success--acclaimed for a candor and thoughtfulness rare in celebrity autobiographies and for its painful evocation of life as a black peformer in segregated America. Davis's 1980 memoir, <i>Why Me?</i>, laid bare Davis's troubled relationship to the Kennedys, his ambivalence toward the Black Pride movement, the end of his marriage to Britt (and his complex open marriage with Altovise Davis), and his flamboyant, self-loathing misbehavior, from ruinous extravagance to flirtations with Satanism.Davis's co-writer Burt Boyar has revised Davis's memoirs, incorporating material from unpublished interviews, and has added a new introduction and epilogue.

The United States decides to send the Bureau of Reclamation to build a dam on the Mekong River near a village called Da Trinh Sanh. The dam will divert the river from the rice basket of Asia, the Mekong Delta, and destroy the country. It is the biggest operation of the war and the largest public-works project ever. Twenty years later, four people are trying to put together what happened. Why did the dam fail? How close did they come to destroying Vietnam? They were all there, but they all remember different things. One was on a gunboat on the river, one was an engineer on the dam, one was a biologist in Saigon, one was a photographer in the field. None of them can quite tell the whole story. Zero Tolerance is the story of their contact with the Bureau of Reclamation, which is not merely a government operation but an agency for turning America into a country of diverted rivers, a nation moving against nature itself. An inventive first novel about the psychology of obsession, in which the environment becomes an instrument of war and technology the most dangerous weapon of all, Zero Tolerance marks an astonishing debut."

Sari Nusseibeh’s autobiography is a remarkable book—one in which his dramatic life story and that of his embattled country converge in a work of great passion, depth, and emotional power. Nusseibeh was raised to represent his country. His family’s roots in Palestine traced back to the Middle Ages, and his father was the governor of Jerusalem. Educated at Oxford, he was trained to build upon his father’s support for coexistence and a negotiated solution to the problems of the region.
<p>But the wars of 1967 and 1973 spelled the beginning of the end for the vision of a unified Palestine—and Nusseibeh’s response to these events, and to those that followed, gives us the recent history from a Palestinian point of view as no book has done. From his time teaching side by side with Israelis at Hebrew University through his appointment by Yassir Arafat to administer Arab Jerusalem, he holds fast to a two-state solution, even as the powers around him insist that it is impossible. As Palestine is torn apart by settlements and barricades, corruption and violence, Nusseibeh remains true to the ideals of his youth, determined to keep hold of some faint hope for the life of his country.</p>
<p><i>Once Upon a Country</i> is a book with the scope and vitality of an old-fashioned novel—one whose ending is still uncertain.</p>"

9780374299576,Zulu: An Irish Journey,['Joan Mathieu'],"For generations, Ireland has been deeply marked by emigration. By living in one small town in central Ireland - Roscrea, County Tipperary - Joan Mathieu hoped to discover why people continue to leave, and to examine the effect of their departure on those who remain behind. Mathieu's grandmother Sarah left Roscrea for New York City in 1912 at the height of Irish emigration. Zulu is thus both a personal exploration and a more general portrait of a community defined by absences. From her superstitious old relatives to her young housemates who work at the local ribbon factory, from rebellious Catholic schoolteachers to more or less settled Travelers, Mathieu gives a vivid sense of life in this town of four thousand people and forty pubs. Mathieu also talks to modern Irish immigrants in New York and discovers that the whole process of emigration has changed because it no longer means leaving for good. These new Irish will not establish roots in their new world, and, surprisingly, they meet with a good deal of antagonism from the established Irish-American community."
9780374299613,The Afterlife: A Memoir,['Donald Antrim'],"<b>From ""a fiercely intelligent writer"" (<i>The New York Times</i>), a wry, poignant story of the difficult love between a mother and a son</b> In the winter of 2000, shortly after his mother’s death from cancer and malnourishment, Donald Antrim, author of the absurdist, visionary masterworks <i>Elect Mr. Robinson for a Better World</i>, <i>The Hundred Brothers,</i> and <i>The Verificationist</i>, began writing about his family. In pieces that appeared in <i>The New Yorker</i> and were anthologized in <i>Best American Essays</i>, Antrim explored<br>
his intense and complicated relationships with his mother, Louanne, an artist and teacher who was, at her worst, a ferociously destabilized and destabilizing alcoholic; his gentle grandfather, who lived in the mountains of North Carolina and who always hoped to save his daughter from herself; and his father, who married Louanne twice. <br>
<i>The Afterlife</i> is not a temporally linear coming-of-age memoir; instead, Antrim follows a logic of unconscious life, of dreams and memories, of fantasies and psychoses, the way in which the world of the alcoholic becomes a sleepless, atemporal world. In it, he comes to terms with—and fails to comes to terms with—the nature of addiction and the broken states of loneliness, shame, and loss that remain beyond his power to fully repair. This is a tender and even blackly hilarious portrait of a family—faulty, cracked, enraging. It is also the story of the way the author works, in part through writing this book, to become a man more fully alive to himself and to others, a man capable of a life in which he may never learn, or ever hope to know, the nature of his origins."
9780374299620,Specimen Days,['Michael Cunningham'],"<p>In each section of Michael Cunningham's bold new novel, his first since <i>The Hours</i>, we encounter the same group of characters: a young boy, an older man, and a young woman. ""In the Machine"" is a ghost story that takes place at the height of the industrial revolution, as human beings confront the alienating realities of the new machine age. ""The Children's Crusade,"" set in the early twenty-first century, plays with the conventions of the noir thriller as it tracks the pursuit of a terrorist band that is detonating bombs, seemingly at random, around the city. The third part, ""Like Beauty,"" evokes a New York 150 years into the future, when the city is all but overwhelmed by refugees from the first inhabited planet to be contacted by the people of Earth.</p>
<p>Presiding over each episode of this interrelated whole is the prophetic figure of the poet Walt Whitman, who promised his future readers, ""It avails not, neither time or place . . . I am with you, and know how it is."" <i>Specimen Days</i> is a genre-bending, haunting, and transformative ode to life in our greatest city and a meditation on the direction and meaning of America's destiny. It is a work of surpassing power and beauty by one of the most original and daring writers at work today.</p>"

9780374299668,The Other Side Of The Altar: One Man's Life In The Catholic Priesthood,['Paul E. Dinter'],"In all the coverage of the priestly sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic Church, one story has been left untold: the story of the everyday lives of Catholic priests in America, which remain so little understood as to be a secret, even as one priestly sexual predation after another has come to light.<br>
<br>
In <i>The Other Side of the Altar</i>, Paul Dinter tells one priest's story--his own--in such a way as to reveal the lives of a generation of priests that spanned two very different eras. These priests entered the ministry in the 1960s, when Catholic seminaries were full of young men inspired by both the Church's ancient faith and the Second Vatican Council's promises of renewal. But by the early 1970s, the priesthood--and the celibate fraternity it depended upon--proved quite different from what the Council had promised. American society had changed, too, particularly in the area of sexuality. As a result, there emerged a clerical subculture of denial and duplicity, which all but guaranteed that the sexual abuse of children by priests would be routinely covered up by the Church's bishops.<br>
<br>
Dinter, now married and raising two stepdaughters, left the priesthood in 1994 over the issue of celibacy, but not before having occasion to reflect on the whole range of priestly struggles with celibacy and sexual life in general--in Rome and rural England, on an Ivy League campus, and in parish rectories of the archdiocese of New York. His candid and affecting account--written from the other side of the altar, so to speak--makes clear that celibacy, sexuality, and power among the clergy have long been intertwined, and suggests how much must change if the Catholic Church hopes to regainthe trust of its people.<br>"

<p>Johann Wolfgang von Goethe is often remembered only as a figure of literary genius, author of <i>The Sorrows of Young Werther</i> and <i>Faust</i>. Yet Goethe was driven by much more than the desire for literary success: he wanted (much the same as us) to live life well.</p>
<p>In <i>Love, Life, Goethe</i>, John Armstrong tells the dramatic life story of this great poet—a representative man akin to Wordsworth in England or Emerson in America. In so doing, he subtly and imaginatively explores the ways that we can learn from Goethe, whether in love, suffering, friendship, or family. At the center of the project is the human yearning for happiness: In an imperfect world, how can we live well with what we have, and accept what we haven’t? From our lives at home, to our attitude toward money and the politicians we choose, Armstrong explores the main themes of our lives through the life of Goethe, and helps us learn how to live.</p>"

9780374299750,"Shades Of Hiawatha: Staging Indians, Making Americans, 1880-1930",['Alan Trachtenberg'],"<b>Winner of the 2005 Francis Parkman Prize</b> A century ago, U.S. policy aimed to sever the tribal allegiances of Native Americans, limit their ancient liberties, and coercively prepare them for citizenship. At the same time millions of arriving immigrants sought their freedom by means of that same citizenship. In this subtle, eye-opening new work, Alan Trachtenberg argues that the two developments were, inevitably, juxtaposed: Indians and immigrants together preoccupied the public imagination, and together changed the idea of what it meant to be American. 
<p>To begin with, programs of ""Americanization"" were organized for both groups, yet Indians were at the same time celebrated as noble ""First Americans"" and role models. Trachtenberg traces the peculiar effect of this implicit contradiction, with Indians themselves staging ""The Song of Hiawatha"" (which was also translated into Yiddish); Edward Curtis's poignant photographs memorializing vanishing heroism; and the Wanamaker department store making a fortune from commercialized versions of their once reviled cultures. By 1925 the national narrative had been rewritten, and citizenship was granted to Indians as a birthright, while the National Origins Act began to close the door on immigrants.</p>
<p><i>In Shades of Hiawatha</i>, Trachtenberg eloquently suggests that we must re-create America's tribal creation story in new ways if we are to reaffirm its beckoning promise of universal liberty.<br>

Taken together, they give us an extraordinary picture of the West and an appreciation of the human need to be free -- for as African American settlers were enjoying newfound freedom, their Native American neighbors were fighting to preserve theirs.</p>

It’s Mr. Howland, with his tousled blond hair and his beautiful guitar and his spot-on impression of Dracula, who makes Edna feel happy for the first time in a long time. But what does Mr. Howland want? And how does Edna really feel – about her mother, about Mr. Howland, about moving forward?</p>
<p>Set in New Jersey in the 1980s, this is a piercing story about decisions both heart-wrenching and wonderful, and how life and love so often lead us down unexpected paths.</p>"

<p>From battling toothaches while fighting the British, to having rotten teeth removed by his dentists, the Father of His Country suffered all his life with tooth problems. Yet, contrary to popular belief, he never had a set of wooden teeth. Starting at the age of twenty-four, George Washington lost on average a tooth a year, and by the time he was elected President, he had only two left! In this reverentially funny tale written in verse and based on Washington’s letters, diaries, and other historical records, readers will find out what really happened as they follow the trail of lost teeth to complete <i>tooflessness</i>.</p>
<p>Illustrated in watercolors with subtle humor by Brock Cole, the main story is followed by a four-page time line featuring reproduced period portraits of Washington.&nbsp;<i>George Washington's Teeth</i> is a 2004 Bank Street - Best Children's Book of the Year.</p>

<p>In 1863 Union colonel Benjamin H. Grierson was chosen for a secret mission: to lead three regiments of horsemen and a battery of artillery — seventeen hundred men in all — on a slashing raid through the state of Mississippi. Their objective was to damage a major Confederate rail line, spreading alarm and destroying enemy supplies in the process. Union leaders were relying on Grierson to provide cover as they moved thousands of troops into position for a major and ultimately victorious assault on Vicksburg, the South's vital transportation hub on the Mississippi River. Owing to Grierson's shrewd tactics, as well as luck and the skilled soldiering of his men, the raid was wildly successful in every respect.</p>
<p>Here is an exciting day-by-day account of this grueling sixteen-day adventure, which weaves together several first-person accounts from Grierson and his soldiers themselves and is heavily illustrated with maps and period photographs.</p>


                        <p>Describes Colonel Benjamin H. Grierson's sixteen-day raid through central Mississippi in the spring of 1863, which distracted Confederate attention while Union troops moved on Vicksburg.

A <i>NEW YORK TIMES</i> BEST SELLER&nbsp;“I was born at the beginning of it all, on the Red side—the Communist side—of the Iron Curtain.” Through annotated illustrations, journals, maps, and dreamscapes, Peter Sís shows what life was like for a child who loved to draw, proudly wore the red scarf of a Young Pioneer, stood guard at the giant statue of Stalin, and believed whatever he was told to believe. But adolescence brought questions. Cracks began to appear in the Iron Curtain, and news from the West slowly filtered into the country. Sís learned about beat poetry, rock ’n’ roll, blue jeans, and Coca-Cola. He let his hair grow long, secretly read banned books, and joined a rock band. Then came the Prague Spring of 1968, and for a teenager who wanted to see the world and meet the Beatles, this was a magical time. It was short-lived, however, brought to a sudden and brutal end by the Soviet-led invasion. But this brief flowering had provided a glimpse of new possibilities—creativity could be discouraged but not easily killed. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
By joining memory and history, Sís takes us on his extraordinary journey: from infant with paintbrush in hand to young man borne aloft by the wings of his art.&nbsp;<i>The Wall</i> is a 2007 New York Times Book Review Best Illustrated Book of the Year, a 2008 Caldecott Honor Book, a 2008 Bank Street - Best Children's Book of the Year, the winner of the 2008 Boston Globe - Horn Book Award for Nonfiction, and a nominee for the 2008 Eisner Award for Best Publication for Kids.

So when the small fishing boat on which fourteen-year-old Manjiro was working was shipwrecked, he despaired of ever returning to his village. The captain of the American whaling ship that rescued Manjiro took a special interest in him, inviting him to come live in Massachusetts.

For eighteen-year-old Nell Edmonds, however, the ""turn"" into 1900 is an ominous and terrifying period. Nell had hoped to follow in the footsteps of Grandmother Shaw by going to college, perhaps even fighting for women's suffrage in Boston. Instead, they offer her another way to leave the farm: her cousin, Anson, has asked for her hand in marriage. At first, Nell is outraged, but then she realizes that for her parents' sake she must accept Anson's proposal.<br>
In the months before the wedding, Nell takes refuge in making a crazy quilt from Grandmother Shaw's scrap fabrics. Never one for needlework, she surprises everyone with her new self-discipline. Yet her family and friends are worried: Nell is obsessed with creating the quilt and she seems to be retreating deep into a world of her own, where no one can help her.<br>
Susan Terris is the author of numerous books for young readers. Her more recent novel, ""The Latchkey Kids,"" was praised by The Voice for Youth Advocates for its ""well-written, realistic dialogue and situations."" Ms. Terris lives in San Francisco.</p>


                        <p>Urged at the age of eighteen to marry a man she doesn't want, Nell delays the event by working on a quilt, slowly starving herself, and observing the unhappy lot of many women in turn-of-the century Massachusetts before arriving at a decision to rescue herself from the brink of death and take charge of her life.

<p>In a series of candid free-form poems, Karen English presents the thoughts of six third-grade children in one day and one classroom at an inner-city public school. Malcolm is the central observer, but also a dreamer. Rica has turned eight today, and her real father will be picking her up later. Brianna is upset because Rica has given over ""best friend"" status to Neecy. There's Lamont, who aspires to be teacher's pet, and Tyrell, a kid bound for trouble from the moment he arrives.</p>
<p>Inspired by her own experience as an elementary school teacher, Ms. English captures voices that reflect a range of emotion and interest children will easily identify with, and Amy June Bates's watercolors breathe pictorial life into the characters.</p>


                        <p>Describes events of one day at a San Francisco Bay Area school as perceived by different second-graders, from the observations of first to arrive on the playground to the walk home.

When the godchild Atum emerges from inky silence to begin his work of creation, he first conjures up the passionate gods of air and rain, followed by Geb, god of the earth, and Nut, goddess of the sky. But earth and sky cling to each other, sharing whispered secrets and laughter, leaving Atum no room to complete his creation. So Atum has no choice but to force them apart, infuriating Geb and leaving Nut sad and lonely . . . until Thoth, the god of wisdom, takes pity on her.<br>

<b>""If they had seen what we see, they would have judged as we judge."" -- Galileo Galilei</b>
<p>In every age there are courageous people who break with tradition to explore new ideas and challenge accepted truths. Galileo Galilei was just such a man--a genius--and the first to turn the telescope to the skies to map the heavens. In doing so, he offered objective evidence that the earth was not the fixed center of the universe but that it and all the other planets revolved around the sun. Galileo kept careful notes and made beautiful drawings of all that he observed. Through his telescope he brought the starts down to earth for everyone to see.</p>
<p>By changing the way people saw the galaxy, Galileo was also changing the way they saw themselves and their place in the universe. This was very exciting, but to some to some it was deeply disturbing. Galileo has upset the harmonious view of heaven and earth that had been accepted since ancient times. He had turned the world upside down.</p>
<p>In this amazing new book, Peter Sís employs the artist's lens to give us an extraordinary view of the life of Galileo Galilei. Sís tells his story in language as simple as a fairy tale, in pictures as rich and tightly woven as a tapestry, and in Galileo's own words, written more than 350 years ago and still resonant with truth.&nbsp;<i>Starry Messenger</i> is a 1997 Caldecott Honor Book.</p>


                        <p>Describes the life and work of the courageous man who changed the way people saw the galaxy, by offering objective evidence that the earth was not the fixed center of the universe.

<p>From the boys who sailed with Columbus to today's young activists, this unique book brings to life the contributions of young people throughout American history. Based on primary sources and including 160 authentic images, this handsome oversized volume highlights the fascinating stories of more than 70 young people from diverse cultures. Young readers will be hooked into history as they meet individuals their own age who were caught up in our country's most dramatic moments-Olaudah Equiano, kidnapped from his village in western Africa and forced into slavery, Anyokah, who helped her father create a written Cherokee language, Johnny Clem, the nine-year-old drummer boy who became a Civil War hero, and Jessica Govea, a teenager who risked joining Cesar Chavez's fight for a better life for farmworkers. Throughout, Philip Hoose's own lively, knowledgeable voice provides a rich historical context-making this not only a great reference-but a great read. The first U.S. history book of this scope to focus on the role young people have played in the making of our country, its compelling stories combine to tell our larger national story, one that prompts Howard Zinn, author of <i>A People's History of the United States</i>, to comment, ""This is an extraordinary book-wonderfully readable, inspiring to young and old alike, and unique.""&nbsp;<i>We Were There Too!</i> is a 2001 National Book Award Finalist for Young People's Literature.<br>

He's not a champion horse trainer like his father, or a popular stage actor like his mother. Still, Case is determined to make his mark. But one effort after another - talent show, science fair, junior horse show - is a terrible failure. It isn't until Case comes upon a lost dog that he finds his path to success. The dog, whom Case names Noah, is certainly one of a kind - what other golden retriever can answer the telephone and put dishes in the dishwasher? Together Case and Noah seem destined to become a trophy-winning team. Noah, however, is so smart because he was trained to be a service dog, and when Case learns about his dog's past, he realizes there is more than one way to be a winner.</p>
<p>With thoughtful black-and-white illustrations, this is the perfect story for any child who has struggled to discover his talents - and for any dog lover.</p>"
9780374384500,Wings And Rockets: The Story Of Women In Air And Space,['Jeannine Atkins'],"<p><b>Celebrating the hundredth anniversary of powered flight</b><br>
<br>
From Katharine Wright, sister of the Wright brothers, to Eileen Collins, the first woman commander of a spacecraft, scores of women have played critical roles in our country’s history of aviation. Wilbur and Orville Wright, who pioneered powered flight in 1903, knew how much they owed to Katharine. “When the world speaks of the Wrights,” said Orville, “they should not forget our sister.” Although Katharine Wright was among the first women to ride in an airplane, Blanche Stuart Scott was the first to sit at the controls. To achieve her dream, Blanche overcame sexism and other obstacles. The same can be said of every woman whose piloting career is highlighted here – Bessie Coleman, Amelia Earhart, Jackie Cochran, Ann Baumgartner Carl, Jerrie Cobb, Shannon Wells Lucid, and others. Their stories are sure to fire the imaginations of readers and encourage them to “follow their hearts into the sky” – or anywhere at all.<br>
<br>
This beautifully articulated history of American women who broke barriers to achieve an especially satisfying success is enhanced by clever, captivating halftone illustrations.</p>


                        <p>Tells the stories of women who have dared to challenge prejudices and rules to take their place in the skies--from Katherine Wright and Bessie Coleman to Jackie Cochran, Shannon Lucid, and Eileen Collins.

But when the barque Stefano runs aground, sixteen-year-old Miho Baccich's thrilling adventure is over. Although ten of the seventeen-man crew struggle to shore, it is soon clear that their greatest challenge was not surviving the sea. The North West Cape of Australia is barren--plagued by heat and cyclones--and after three desperate months, all but two of the sailors have starved to death. Finally, Miho and another teenager, Ivan Jurich--themselves driven to cannibalism--are rescued by aborigines. They join the tribe in its relentless trek for food and water, until a pearling ship turns toward shore in a storm and discovers the castaways. A year after the wreck, the two returned to Dubrovnik, where they told their story to a Jesuit scholar. Gustave Rathe, Miho Baccich's grandson, first read the account as a boy in 1930. He has sought out other descendants of the principal characters and pinpointed the sites of much of the story. His deft adaptation of the document unlocks an account which rivals Robinson Crusoe and Treasure Island in drama and detail, and may surpass them in emotion and insight.

                        <p>One of only ten crew members to make it to shore after a shipwreck, sixteen-year-old Miho Baccich struggles to survive, with the aid of an aboriginal tribe, on the desolate North West Cape of Australia.

<p><i>As far as I can judge, I am not apt to follow blindly the lead of other men . . .</i></p>
<p>Charles Darwin was, above all else, an independent thinker who continues even now to influence the way we look at the natural world. His endless curiosity and passion for detail resulted in a wealth of notebooks, diaries, correspondence, and published writings that Peter Sís transforms into a visual treasure trove. A multilayered journey through Darwin’s world, <i>The Tree of Life</i> begins with his childhood and traces the arc of his life through university and career, following him around the globe on the voyage of the Beagle, and home to a quiet but momentous life devoted to science and family. Sís uses his own singular vision to create a gloriously detailed panorama of a genius’s trajectory through investigating and understanding the mysteries of nature. In pictures executed in fine pen and ink and lush watercolors – cameo portraits, illustrated pages of diary, cutaway views of the Beagle, as well as charts, maps, and a gatefold spread – Peter Sís has shaped a wondrous introduction to Charles Darwin.&nbsp;<i>The Tree of Life</i> is a 2003 New York Times Book Review Best Illustrated Book of the Year and Notable Children's Book of the Year, and a 2004 Bank Street - Best Children's Book of the Year.</p>

<p><i>Night</i> is Elie Wiesel’s masterpiece, a candid, horrific, and deeply poignant autobiographical account of his survival as a teenager in the Nazi death camps. This new translation by Marion Wiesel, Elie’s wife and frequent translator, presents this seminal memoir in the language and spirit truest to the author’s original intent. And in a substantive new preface, Elie reflects on the enduring importance of Night and his lifelong, passionate dedication to ensuring that the world never forgets man’s capacity for inhumanity to man.</p>
<p><i>Night</i> offers much more than a litany of the daily terrors, everyday perversions, and rampant sadism at Auschwitz and Buchenwald; it also eloquently addresses many of the philosophical as well as personal questions implicit in any serious consideration of what the Holocaust was, what it meant, and what its legacy is and will be.</p>
<p>Author Bio: Elie Wiesel is the internationally celebrated author, Nobel laureate, and spokesperson for humanity whose decision to dedicate his life to bearing witness for the Holocaust's martyrs and survivors found its earliest and most enduring voice in Night, his penetrating and profound account of the Nazi death camps. Born in the town of Sighet, Transylvania, he was a teenager when he and his family were taken from their home in 1944 to the Auschwitz concentration camp, and then to Buchenwald. Night is the terrifying record of Elie Wiesel's memories of the death of his family, the death of his own innocence, and his despair as a deeply observant Jew confronting the absolute evil of man.</p>
<p>Elie Wiesel is the author of more than forty internationally acclaimed works of fiction and nonfiction. He has been awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the United States of America Congressional Gold Medal, the French Legion of Honor, and, in 1986, the Nobel Peace Prize. He is the Andrew W. Mellon Professor in the Humanities and University Professor at Boston University.</p>

<p>Introduction by Kevin Baker</p>
<p><i>The Natural</i>, Bernard Malamud’s first novel, published in 1952, is also the first—and some would say still the best—novel ever written about baseball. In it Malamud, usually appreciated for his unerring portrayals of postwar Jewish life, took on very different material—the story of a superbly gifted “natural” at play in the fields of the old daylight baseball era—and invested it with the hardscrabble poetry, at once grand and altogether believable, that runs through all his best work. Four decades later, Alfred Kazin’s comment still holds true: “Malamud has done something which—now that he has done it!—looks as if we have been waiting for it all our lives. He has really raised the whole passion and craziness and fanaticism of baseball as a popular spectacle to its ordained place in mythology.”</p>

It contains sketches of orange growers, orange botanists, orange pickers, orange packers, early settlers on Florida’s Indian River, the first orange barons, modern concentrate makers, and a fascinating profile of Ben Hill Griffin of Frostproof, Florida who may be the last of the individual orange barons. McPhee’s astonishing book has an almost narrative progression, is immensely readable, and is frequently amusing. Louis XIV hung tapestries of oranges in the halls of Versailles, because oranges and orange trees were the symbols of his nature and his reign. This book, in a sense, is a tapestry of oranges, too—with elements in it that range from the great orangeries of European monarchs to a custom of people in the modern Caribbean who split oranges and clean floors with them, one half in each hand.</p>"

Thomas Merton writes: When society is made up of men who know no interior solitude it can no longer be held together by love: and consequently it is held together by a violent and abusive authority. But when men are violently deprived of the solitude and freedom which are their due, the society in which they live becomes putrid, it festers with servility, resentment and hate.<p><i>Thoughts in Solitude</i> stands alongside <i>The Seven Storey Mountain</i> as one of Merton's most uring and popular works. Thomas Merton, a Trappist monk, is perhaps the foremost spiritual thinker of the twentiethcentury.

9780374522698,For Your Own Good: Hidden Cruelty In Child-rearing And The Roots Of Violence,['Alice Miller'],"<p><i>For Your Own Good</i>, the contemporary classic exploring the serious if not gravely dangerous consequences parental cruelty can bring to bear on children everywhere, is one of the central works by Alice Miller, the celebrated Swiss psychoanalyst.</p>
<p>With her typically lucid, strong, and poetic language, Miller investigates the personal stories and case histories of various self-destructive and/or violent individuals to expand on her theories about the long-term affects of abusive child-rearing. Her conclusions—on what sort of parenting can create a drug addict, or a murderer, or a Hitler—offer much insight, and make a good deal of sense, while also straying far from psychoanalytic dogma about human nature, which Miller vehemently rejects.</p>
<p>This important study paints a shocking picture of the violent world—indeed, of the ever-more-violent world—that each generation helps to create when traditional upbringing, with its hidden cruelty, is perpetuated. The book also presents readers with useful solutions in this regard—namely, to resensitize the victimized child who has been trapped within the adult, and to unlock the emotional life that has been frozen in repression.</p>


                        <p>In a new preface, the author describes the radical change in her attitude toward psychoanalysis and warns her readers that she considers psychoanalytic treatment to be obscure, misleading and even dangerous.

Few poets take us more directly and memorably to what Lorca described as ""the dark root of the scream,"" the terrain of the duende, where inspiration delivers a new poetic reality and ""intelligence"" discovers its limitations.For many years, until the recent publication of FSG's <i>Collected Poems,</i> English readers' view of Lorca has been determined by a few well-known books-<i>The Divan at Tamarit, Poet in New York, The Gypsy Ballads</i>-and by a lamentably small number of poems. Now this <i>Selected Verse,</i> the most complete paperback anthology available in English, draws on FSG's two-volume <i>Poetical Works,</i> providing authoritative versions by outstanding poets and translators: Francisco Aragon, Catherine Brown, Cola Franzen, Will Kirkland, William Bryant Logan, Jerome Rothernberge, Greg Simon, Alan S. Trueblood, John K. Walsh, and Steven F. White.

Ronald Segal's account begins in Africa itself, with the cultures and societies flourishing there before the arrival of the Atlantic slave trade, which transported over ten million people to the Americas, after killing at least as many in their procurement and passage. He examines the extent of the profits made through the trade by merchants, manufacturers, investors, and planters, along with the racist ideology that developed as whites strove to rationalize an enormous economic dependence. Segal describes the various ways in which the system of slavery developed and provides the most comprehensive account to date of the resistance by the slaves themselves, from escape and arson to guerrilla warfare and revolution. When emancipation finally came, the former slaves were left in the fetters of poverty and discrimination. Segal details the course of the struggle against colonial rule and the racial oppressions of self-styled democracies. In recounting his own travels through the Diaspora, he shows the continuing plight of peoples confined by the consequences of the past and the prejudices of the present: racked by violence, as in Jamaica and the ghettos of America; denied the right to assert their sense of identity, as in Cuba; acknowledged only to be repudiated, as in Brazil. Yet this is also, Segal reveals, a Diaspora of wondrous achievement. It has immeasurably enriched world culture in music, language and literature, painting, sculpture and architecture; has done much to make sports a form of art; and has invested Western culture with the ecological reverence derived from its African source. Segal argues that the black Diaspora has a unique destiny, infused by the love of freedom that is its creative impulse."

A classic coming-of-age story in the tradition of <i>The Catcher in the Rye</i> and <i>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man,</i> Kincaid’s novel focuses on a universal, tragic, and often comic theme: the loss of childhood. Annie’s voice—urgent, demanding to be heard—is one that will not soon be forgotten by readers.</p>
<p>An adored only child, Annie has until recently lived an idyllic life. She is inseparable from her beautiful mother, a powerful presence, who is the very center of the little girl’s existence. Loved and cherished, Annie grows and thrives within her mother’s benign shadow. Looking back on her childhood, she reflects, “It was in such a paradise that I lived.” When she turns twelve, however, Annie’s life changes, in ways that are often mysterious to her. She begins to question the cultural assumptions of her island world; at school she instinctively rebels against authority; and most frighteningly, her mother, seeing Annie as a “young lady,” ceases to be the source of unconditional adoration and takes on the new and unfamiliar guise of adversary. At the end of her school years, Annie decides to leave Antigua and her family, but not without a measure of sorrow, especially for the mother she once knew and never ceases to mourn. “For I could not be sure,” she reflects, “whether for the rest of my life I would be able to tell when it was really my mother and when it was really her shadow standing between me and the rest of the world.""</p>"

As he does so, he argues that roots of gay identity by showing how the Puritan compact led to the backroom bawdy house, how being ""born again"" is reenacted as ""coming out,"" and how gay men's search for their own identity profoundly echoes American's relentless quest for a national identity of its own.

In assessing why women’s careers and psyches are suffering, Conley provides a first-person look into what it is like to be an accomplished woman within this restrictive medical world, offering invaluable advice to patients and future doctors alike.</p>"

<p>""Poetry is a vocal, which is to say a bodily, art,"" Robert Pinsky declares in <i>The Sounds of Poetry</i>. ""The medium of poetry is the human body: the column of air inside the chest, shaped into signifying sounds in the larynx and the mouth. In this sense, poetry is as physical or bodily an art as dancing.""</p>
<p>As Poet Laureate, Pinsky is one of America's best spokesmen for poetry. In this fascinating book, he explains how poets use the ""technology"" of poetry—its sounds—to create works of art that are ""performed"" in us when we read them aloud.</p>
<p>He devotes brief, informative chapters to accent and duration, syntax and line, like and unlike sounds, blank and free verse. He cites examples from the work of fifty different poets—from Shakespeare, Donne, and Herbert to W. C. Williams, Frost, Elizabeth Bishop, C. K. Williams, Louise Glück, and Frank Bidart.</p>
<p>This ideal introductory volume belongs in the library of every poet and student of poetry.</p>"

His eighth book, it is also his most inviting-full of joy in language, fascination with popular culture, and enthusiasm for the writing of poetry itself. This is the first of his books to really capture the effect of America on his poetic sensibility, which is like a magnet for impressions and the miscellany of the culture.</p>"

<p>In the three plays in <i>The Old Glory—Endecott and the Red Cross</i>; <i>My Kinsman, Major Molineux</i>; and <i>Benito Cereno</i>—the most powerful figure in postwar American poetry confronts the most haunting American fiction writers of the nineteenth century. The result is a mythical, nightmare history of three centuries in America. In Endecott and the Red Cross, Hawthorne's Puritan governor, horrified by his colony's high living, declares, ""Everything in America will be Bible, blood and iron. / England will no longer exist."" The other two plays, based on Hawthorne's <i>My Kinsman, Major Molineux</i> and Melville's <i>Benito Cereno</i>, take up the themes of parricide and independence: one in Boston on the eve of the Revolutionary War, the other on a merchant ship in the Caribbean in the early nineteenth century.</p>
<p>The plays were first performed in 1964, when the poet Randall Jarrell wrote: ""I have never seen a better American play than <i>Benito Cereno</i>, the major play in Robert Lowell's <i>The Old Glory</i> . . . The play is a masterpiece of imaginative knowledge.""</p>"

Told through the stories of Mexicans who helped make the transformation, the book gives new and gripping behind-the-scenes accounts of major episodes in Mexico's recent politics.</p>
<p>Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary Party, led by presidents who ruled like Mesoamerican monarchs, came to be called ""the perfect dictatorship."" But a 1968 massacre of student protesters by government snipers ignited the desire for democratic change in a generation of Mexicans. <i>Opening Mexico</i> recounts the democratic revolution that unfolded over the following three decades. It portrays clean-vote crusaders, labor organizers, human rights monitors, investigative journalists, Indian guerrillas, and dissident political leaders, such as President Ernesto Zedillo-Mexico's Gorbachev. It traces the rise of Vicente Fox, who toppled the authoritarian system in a peaceful election in July 2000.</p>

This is the story of the inexorable drift of nuclear weapons technology from the hands of the rich into the hands of the poor. As more unstable and undeveloped nations find ways of acquiring the ultimate arms, the stakes of state-sponsored nuclear activity have soared to frightening heights. Even more disturbing is the likelihood of such weapons being manufactured and deployed by guerrilla non-state terrorists. Langewiesche also recounts the recent history of Abdul Qadeer Khan, the scientist at the forefront of nuclear development and trade in the Middle East who masterminded the theft and sale of centrifuge designs that helped to build Pakistan's nuclear arsenal, and who single-handedly peddled nuclear plans to North Korea, Iran, and other potentially hostile countries. He then examines in dramatic and tangible detail the chances for nuclear terrorism. From Hiroshima to the present day, Langewiesche describes a reality of urgent consequence to us all. This searing, provocative, and timely report is a triumph of investigative journalism, and a masterful laying out of the most critical political problem the world now faces.</p>"

<p>She has been called the female Lawrence of Arabia, which, while not inaccurate, fails to give Gertrude Bell her due. She was at one time the most powerful woman in the British Empire: a nation builder, the driving force behind the creation of modern-day Iraq. Born in 1868 into a world of privilege, Bell turned her back on Victorian society, choosing to read history at Oxford and going on to become an archaeologist, spy, Arabist, linguist, author (of <i>Persian Pictures</i>, <i>The Desert and the Sown</i>, and many other collections), poet, photographer, and legendary mountaineer (she took off her skirt and climbed the Alps in her underclothes).</p>
<p>She traveled the globe several times, but her passion was the desert, where she traveled with only her guns and her servants. Her vast knowledge of the region made her indispensable to the Cairo Intelligence Office of the British government during World War I. She advised the Viceroy of India; then, as an army major, she traveled to the front lines in Mesopotamia. There, she supported the creation of an autonomous Arab nation for Iraq, promoting and manipulating the election of King Faisal to the throne and helping to draw the borders of the fledgling state. <i>Gertrude Bell</i>, vividly told and impeccably researched by Georgina Howell, is a richly compelling portrait of a woman who transcended the restrictions of her class and times, and in so doing, created a remarkable and enduring legacy.</p>"
9780374531379,The Dirt On Clean,['Katherine Ashenburg'],"<p>The question of cleanliness is one every age and culture has answered with confidence. For the first-century Roman, being clean meant a two-hour soak in baths of various temperatures, scraping the body with a miniature rake, and a final application of oil. For the aristocratic Frenchman in the seventeenth century, it meant changing your shirt once a day and perhaps going so far as to dip your hands in some water. Did Napoleon know something we didn’t when he wrote to Josephine, “I will return in five days. Stop washing”? And why is the German term <i>Warmduscher</i>—a man who washes in warm or hot water—invariably a slight against his masculinity? Katherine Ashenburg takes on such fascinating questions as these in <i>The Dirt on Clean</i>, her charming tour of attitudes toward hygiene through time. An engrossing fusion of erudition and anecdote, <i>The Dirt on Clean</i> considers the bizarre prescriptions of history’s doctors, the hygienic peccadilloes of great authors, and the historic twists and turns that have brought us to a place Ashenburg considers hedonistic yet oversanitized.</p>"

Residency—and especially its first year, the internship—is legendary for its brutality, and Jauhar’s experience was even more harrowing than most. He switched from physics to medicine in order to follow a more humane calling—only to find that his new profession often had little regard for patients’ concerns. He struggled to find a place among squadrons of cocky residents and doctors. He challenged the practices of the internship in <i>The New York Times</i>, attracting the suspicions of the medical bureaucracy. Then, suddenly stricken, he became a patient himself—and came to see that today’s high-tech, high-pressure medicine can be a humane science after all. Jauhar’s beautifully written memoir explains the inner workings of modern medicine with rare candor and insight.</p>"

9780374532383,Concerning E. M. Forster,['Frank Kermode'],"<p>Over the past half century, Frank Kermode established himself as on of the finest literary critics of his generation. Here, Kermode assesses the influence and meaning of all of E. M. Forster's novels, as well as his criticism; reflects on his profound musicality (Benjamin Britten though Forster the most musical of all writers); and offers a fascinating interpretation of his greatest work, A Passage to India.</p>
<p>Cencering E. M. Forster is a brilliant and wide-ranging series of loosely organized, interweaving discussions in which Forster is reduced in size, placed in the wider context of his times, and occasionally scolded for being not quite the author Kermode would have preferred him to be. Kermode reflects not only on Forster's considerable talent but on the social and personal circumstances that restricted it, on the dizzying changes in English society in the first half of the twentieth century, and on the preoccupations and uncertainties of those who, like Forster, found themselves caught between two worlds. Taking Forster as his starting point, Kermode also caste a spotlight on many of the writer's great contemporaries-Joseph Conrad, Henry James, Virginia Woolf, Arnold Bennett, D. H. Lawrence, and H. G. Wells. Concerning E.M. Forster is both a stimulating and original portrait of E. M. Forster and a unique panorama of twentieth-century English letters.</p>"
9780374532444,American Original,['Joan Biskupic'],"<p>If the U.S. Supreme Court teaches us anything, it is that almost everything is open to interpretation. Almost. But what’s inarguable is that, while the Court has witnessed a succession of larger-than-life jurists in its two-hundred-plus-year history, it has never seen the likes of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.</p>
<p>Combative yet captivating, infuriating yet charming, the outspoken jurist remains a source of curiosity to observers across the political spectrum and on both sides of the ideological divide. But for all his public grandstanding, Scalia has managed to elude biographers—until now. In <i>American Original: The Life and Constitution of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia</i>, the veteran Washington journalist Joan Biskupic presents for the first time a detailed portrait of this complicated figure and provides a comprehensive narrative that will engage Scalia’s adherents and critics alike. Drawing on her long tenure covering the Court and on unprecedented access to the justice, Biskupic delves into the circumstances of his rise and the formation of his rigorous approach on the bench. This book shows us the man in power: his world, his journey, and the far-reaching consequences of a transformed legal landscape.</p>"

9780374532796,Common As Air,['Lewis Hyde'],"<p><i>Common as Air</i> offers a stirring defense of our cultural commons, that vast store of art and ideas we have inherited from the past and continue to enrich in the present. Suspicious of the current idea that all creative work is “intellectual property,” Lewis Hyde turns to America’s Founding Fathers—men such as Adams, Madison, and Jefferson—in search of other ways to imagine the fruits of human wit and imagination. What he discovers is a rich tradition in which knowledge was assumed to be a commonwealth, not a private preserve.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the founders, democratic self-governance itself demanded open and easy access to ideas. So did the growth of creative communities such as that of eighteenth-century science. And so did the flourishing of public persons, the very actors whose “civic virtue” brought the nation into being.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this lively, carefully argued, and well-documented book, Hyde brings the past to bear on present matters, shedding fresh light on everything from the Human Genome Project to Bob Dylan’s musical roots. <i>Common as Air</i> allows us to stand on the shoulders of America’s revolutionary giants and thus to see beyond today’s narrow debates over cultural ownership. What it reveals is nothing less than a vision of how to reclaim the commonwealth of art and ideas that we were meant to inherit.</p>"

9780374532888,Crimes In Southern Indiana: Stories,"['Bill, Frank , 1974-']","<p><b>A ferocious debut that puts Frank Bill’s southern Indiana on the literary map next to Cormac McCarthy’s eastern Tennessee and Daniel Woodrell’s Missouri Ozarks</b></p>
<p>C<i>rimes in Southern Indiana</i> is the most blistering, vivid, flat-out fearless debut to plow into American literature in recent years. Frank Bill delivers what is both a wake-up call and a gut punch. Welcome to heartland America circa right about now, when the union jobs and family farms that kept the white on the picket fences have given way to meth labs, backwoods gunrunners, and bare-knuckle brawling.</p>
<p>Bill’s people are pressed to the brink—and beyond. There is Scoot McCutchen, whose beloved wife falls terminally ill, leaving him with nothing to live for—which doesn’t quite explain why he brutally murders her and her doctor and flees, or why, after years of running, he decides to turn himself in. In the title story, a man who has devolved from breeding hounds for hunting to training them for dog-fighting crosses paths with a Salvadoran gangbanger tasked with taking over the rural drug trade, but who mostly wants to grow old in peace. As <i>Crimes in Sourthern Indiana</i> unfolds, we witness the unspeakable, yet are compelled to find sympathy for the depraved.</p>
<p>Bill’s southern Indiana is haunted with the deep, authentic sense of place that recalls the best of Southern fiction, but the interconnected stories bristle with the urban energy of a Chuck Palahniuk or a latter-day Nelson Algren and rush with the slam-bang plotting of pulp-noir crime writing à la Jim Thompson. Bill’s prose is gritty yet literary, shocking, and impossible to put down. A dark evocation of the survivalist spirit of the working class, this is a brilliant debut by an important new voice.</p>"
9780374533014,Maggot: Poems,['Paul Muldoon'],"<p>Of <i>Plan B</i>, which included several of the poems in <i>Maggot</i>, Robert McCrum recently said in the London <i>Observer</i> that “Paul Muldoon, who has done so much to reimagine the poet’s task, has surpassed himself with his latest collection.” In his eleventh full-length book, Muldoon reminds us that he is a traditional poet who is steadfastly at odds with tradition. If the poetic sequence is the main mode of <i>Maggot</i>, it certainly isn’t your father’s poetic sequence. Taking as a starting point W. B. Yeats’s remark that the only fit topics for a serious mood are “sex and the dead,” Muldoon finds unexpected ways of thinking and feeling about what it means to come to terms with the early twenty-first century. It’s no accident that the centerpiece of <i>Maggot</i> is an outlandish meditation on a failed poem that draws on the vocabulary of entomological forensics. The last series of linked lyrics, meanwhile, takes as its subject the urge to memorialize the scenes of fatal automobile accidents. The extravagant linkage of rot and the erotic is at the heart of not only the title sequence but also many of the round songs that characterize <i>Maggot</i>, and has led Angela Leighton, writing in <i>The Times Literary Supplement</i>, to see these new poems as giving readers “a thrilling, wild, fairground ride, with few let-ups for the squeamish.”</p>"
9780374533076,Threats: A Novel,['Amelia Gray'],"<p>David’s wife is dead. At least, he thinks she’s dead. But he can’t figure out what killed her or why she had to die, and his efforts to sort out what’s happened have been interrupted by his discovery of a series of elaborate and escalating threats hidden in strange places around his home—one buried in the sugar bag, another carved into the side of his television. These disturbing threats may be the best clues to his wife’s death:</p>
<p>CURL UP ON MY LAP. LET ME BRUSH YOUR HAIR WITH MY FINGERS. I AM SINGING YOU A LULLABY. I AM TESTING FOR STRUCTURAL WEAKNESS IN YOUR SKULL.</p>
<p>Detective Chico is also on the case, and is intent on asking David questions he doesn’t know the answers to and introducing him to people who don’t appear to have David’s or his wife’s best interests in mind. With no one to trust, David is forced to rely on his own memories and faculties—but they too are proving unreliable.</p>
<p>In <i>THREATS</i>, Amelia Gray builds a world that is bizarre yet familiar, violent yet tender. It is an electrifying story of love and loss that grabs you on the first page and never loosens its grip.</p>"
9780374533168,Selected Poems,['Robert Pinsky'],"<p>Intense verbal music with a jazz feeling; invention against the grain of expectation; intelligence racing among materials with the variety of a busy street—these have been the qualities of Robert Pinsky’s work since his first book, <i>Sadness and Happiness</i> (1975), celebrated for setting a new direction in American poetry. At that time, responding to a question about that book, Pinsky said: “I would like to write a poetry which could contain every kind of thing, while keeping all the excitement of poetry.”</p>
<p>That ambition was realized in a new way with each of his books, including the book-length personal monologue <i>An Explanation of America</i>; the transformed autobiography of <i>History of My Heart</i>; the bestselling translation <i>The Inferno of Dante</i>; and, most recently, the savage, inventive <i>Gulf Music</i>.

The war is for her little more than a daydream, until she realizes that her husband might never return. <i>Portrait of the Mother as a Young Woman,</i> winner of the prestigious Georg Büchner prize, is a mesmerizing psychological portrait of the human need to safeguard innocence and integrity at any cost—even at the risk of excluding reality. More than just the story of this single woman, it is a compelling and credible description of a typical young German woman during the Nazi era.</p>"

Bringing up a child, lying to the boss, placing an order in a fast-food restaurant: in Etgar Keret’s new collection, daily life is complicated, dangerous, and full of yearning. In his most playful and most mature work yet, the living and the dead, silent children and talking animals, dreams and waking life coexist in an uneasy world. Overflowing with absurdity, humor, sadness, and compassion, the tales in <i>Suddenly, a Knock on the Door</i> establish Etgar Keret—declared a “genius” by <i>The New York Times</i>—as one of the most original writers of his generation."

In practical terms, the answer is: nobody.<br><br> Even though most American women are in the workplace, Mona Harrington argues that government and business still operate as if there were a large unpaid labor force at home to care for children and aging parents.

Criticizing both sides of the political spectrum - conservatives' reliance on fictitious stay-at-home moms and liberals' narrow focus on workplace equality - Harrington broadens the debate to redefine liberal family values and the programs needed to realize them at home and at the office. The solutions, she suggests, will require both public and private support for health care, family leave, good wages for care workers, and decent housing.<br><br> Proposing policies that will help prevent teen pregnancy, support single-parent families, and relieve the stresses on marriage,<i>Care and Equality</i> offers a tightly reasoned, clichÃ©-free analysis of one of our toughest problems."

Anna Ruth Henriques began the extraordinary pages that would become The Book of Mechtilde at the kitchen table in her grandparents' house outside Kingston, Jamaica, where she grew up. She was twenty-two years old, and for the next seven years she worked on it as an act of love, to both celebrate and mourn her mother, Sheila Mechtilde Henriques, who had died of breast cancer when Anna was eleven years old. Inspired by texts from the Book of Job, Anna tells her mother's story - her youth, her love for her husband and their happy marriage, the birth of her daughters, her slow illness, death, and final peace - all in the form of a fable, sometimes in prose, sometimes in poetry. Each scene is illustrated with a painting encircled with calligraphy and set in a gold border of flowers, fruit, or symbolic creatures. Both the story and the paintings are enriched by Anna's remarkable family heritage - Jewish and Christian, European, African, Chinese, Indian, and Creole - and by her amazing drive to use her enormous artistic gifts to transform loss into a passionate celebration of life."

What makes it so special is that it represents different styles of Southern cooking--Miss Lewis’s Virginia country cooking and Scott Peacock’s inventive and sensitive blending of new tastes with the Alabama foods he grew up on, liberally seasoned with Native American, Caribbean, and African influences. Together they have taken neglected traditional recipes unearthed in their years of research together on Southern food and worked out new versions that they have made their own.
<p>Every page of this beguiling book bears the unmistakable mark of being written by real hands-on cooks. Scott Peacock has the gift for translating the love and respect they share for good home cooking with such care and precision that you know, even if you’ve never tried them before, that the Skillet Cornbread will turn out perfect, the Crab Cakes will be “Honestly Good,” and the four-tiered Lane Cake something spectacular.</p>
<p>Together they share their secrets for such Southern basics as pan-fried chicken (soak in brine first, then buttermilk, before frying in good pork fat), creamy grits (cook slowly in milk), and genuine Southern biscuits, which depend on using soft flour, homemade baking powder, and fine, fresh lard (and on not twisting the biscuit cutter when you stamp out the dough). Scott Peacock describes how Miss Lewis makes soup by coaxing the essence of flavor from vegetables (the She-Crab and Turtle soups taste so rich they can be served in small portions in demitasse cups), and he applies the same principle to his intensely flavored, scrumptious dish of Garlic Braised Shoulder Lamb Chops with Butter Beans and Tomatoes. You’ll find all these treasures and more before you even get to the superb cakes (potential “Cakewalk Winners” all), the hand-cranked ice creams, the flaky pies, and homey custards and puddings.</p>
<p>Interwoven throughout the book are warm memories of the people and the traditions that shaped these pure-<br>
tasting, genuinely American recipes. Above all, the Southern table stands for hospitality, and the authors demonstrate that the way everything is put together--with the condiments and relishes and preserves and wealth of vegetables all spread out on the table--is what makes the meal uniquely Southern. Every occasion is celebrated, and at the back of the book there are twenty-two seasonal menus, from A Spring Country Breakfast for a Late Sunday Morning and A Summer Dinner of Big Flavors to An Alabama Thanksgiving and A Hearty Dinner for a Cold Winter Night, to show you how to mix and match dishes for a true Southern table.<br>
Here, then, is a joyful coming together of two extraordinary cooks, sharing their gifts. And they invite you to join them.</p>"

He writes about Arethaâs evolution as a singer and performer (she came out of the tradition of Mahalia Jackson); before Aretha, there were only two blues-singing gospel women-Dinah Washington, who told it like it was, and Sister Rosetta Tharpe, who specialized, like Aretha, in ambivalence, erotic gospel, and holy blues.</p><p>We see the influence of Arethaâs father, C. L. Franklin, famous pastor of Detroitâs New Bethel Baptist Church. Franklinâs albums preached a theology of liberation and racial pride that sold millions and helped prepare the way for Martin Luther King Jr. Reverend Franklin was considered royalty and, Heilbut writes, it was inevitable that his daughter would become the Queen of Soul.</p><p>In 'The Children and Their Secret Closet,' Heilbut writes about gays in the Pentecostal church, the black churchâs rock and shield for more than a hundred years, its true heroes, and among its most faithful members and vivid celebrants. And he explores, as well, the influential role of gays in the white Pentecostal church.<br> In 'Somebody Elseâs Paradise,' Heilbut writes about the German exiles who fled Hitler-Einstein, Hannah Arendt, Marlene Dietrich, and others-and their long reach into the world of American science, art, politics, and literature. He contemplates the continued relevance of the Ã©migrÃ© Joseph Roth, a Galician Jew, who died an impoverished alcoholic and is now considered the peer of Kafka and Thomas Mann.</p><p>And in 'Brave Tomorrows for Bachelorâs Children,' Heilbut explores the evolution of the soap opera. He writes about the form itself and how it catered to social outcasts and have-nots; the writers insisting its values were traditional, conservative; their critics seeing soap operas as the secret saboteurs of traditional marriage-the women as castrating wives; their husbands as emasculated men. Heilbut writes that soaps went beyond melodrama, deep into the perverse and the surreal, domesticating Freud and making sibling rivalry, transference, and Oedipal and Electra complexes the stuff of daily life.&nbsp;</p><p>And he writes of the 'daytime serialâs unwed mother,' Irna Phillips, a Chicago wannabe actress (a Margaret Hamilton of the shtetl) who created radioâs most seminal soap operas-<i>Todayâs Children</i>, <i>The</i> <i>Road of Life</i> among them-and for television, <i>As the World Turns</i>, <i>Guiding Light</i>, etc., and who became known as the 'queen of the soaps.' Hers, Heilbut writes, was the proud perspective of someone who didnât fit anywhere, the stray no one loved.</p><p><i>The Fan Who Knew Too Much</i> is a revelatory look at some of our American icons and iconic institutions, high, low, and exalted.</p>"

But his personal story - from which he drew extensively to create the characters and plots of his films - is itself an extraordinary human drama. Now, with captivating immediacy, Antoine de Baecque and Serge Toubiana give us the definitive story of this beloved artist. 
<p>They begin with the unwanted, mischievous child who learned to love movies and books as an escape from sadness and confusion: as a boy, Francois came to identify with screen characters and to worship actresses. Following his early adult years as a journalist, during which he gained fame as France's most iconoclastic film critic, the obsessive prodigy began to make films of his own, and before he was thirty, notched the two masterpieces <i>The 400 Blows</i> and <i>Jules and Jim</i> As Truffaut's dazzling body of work evolves, in the shadow of the politics of his day, including the student uprisings of 1968, we watch him learning the lessons of his masters Fellini and Hitchcock. And we witness the progress of his often tempestuous personal relationships, including his violent falling-out with Jean-Luc Goaded )who owed Truffaut the idea for <i>Breathless</i> ) and his rapturous love affairs with the many glamorous actresses he directed, among them Jacqueline Bisset and Jeanne Moreau. With Fanny Ardant, Truffaut had a child only thirteen months before dying of a brain tumor at the age of 52.</p>
<p>Here is a life of astonishing emotional range, from the anguish of severe depression to he exaltation of Oscar victory. Based on unprecedented access to Truffaut's papers, including notes toward and unwritten autobiography, de Baecque and Toubiana's richly detailed work is an incomparably authoritative revelation of a singular genius.</p>"

In almost every situation in our century where mankind has demonstrated its capacity to intensify evil - during the Nazi Holocaust, in Algeria, Chile, Africa, the USSR, and Israel, as well as in postwar Britain and Germany - Bamber has served as a witness, an expert, or a reproach, as well as repository of our collective memory of debasement. She went to Bergen-Belsen after World War II had ended, and upon her return to London she dedicated herself to caring for the young survivors of the camp. So began Bamber's brave devotion to the grim and dangerous task of undoing the work of the torturer - culminating, after her participation as a central force in Amnesty International, in her establishment in England of the Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture. Because Bamber's uncanny openness to others has been one of her great skills, The Good Listener is rendered even more powerful by the stories of the people she has helped, stories that become unforgettable records of meaningless human suffering."

Ultimately, they came to face disappointment, exile, and, on occasion, death. Brilliantly weaving together the strands of a tumultuous century in Arab political thought, history, and poetry, Ajami takes us from the ruins of Beirut's once glittering metropolis to the land of Egypt, where struggle rages between a modernist impulse and an Islamist insurgency, from Nasser's pan-Arab nationalist ambitions to the emergence of an uneasy Pax Americana in Arab lands, from the triumphalism of the Gulf War to the continuing anguished debate over the Israeli-Palestinian peace accords.<br>
<br>
For anyone who seeks to understand the Middle East, here is an insider's unflinching analysis of the collision between intellectual life and political realities in the Arab world today.<br>

<br>
""Fearless and engaging, a virtuoso at bringing the drive of natural speech into social criticism, Stanley Crouch transcends our usual racial divides to write in behalf of any and every American who will read him. <i>Always in Pursuit</i> is irresistible commentary on the American condition just now."" <br>
—Alfred Kazin<br>
<br>
""Stanley Crouch heads right toward issues that other writers shy away from; he is almost scarily fearless. Reading him is like watching a sharpshooter—when he misses, it adds to the showmanship.""&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
—Pauline Kael<br>
<br>
Brash, teasing, belligerent and tender, Crouch knows what he is talking about and he says what he means. When he writes about Duke Ellington or Albert Murray, John Ford or Ralph Ellison, that knowledge and truthfulness make it clear that you don't have to agree with him to learn from him.""<br>
—Robert Pinsky, Poet Laureate<br>
<br>
""Stanley Crouch once again proves himself to be a major iconoclast. His words prick the pages, provoking, irritating, prodding us to question our own easy assumptions on race, sex, politics, art, jazz, history, civilization, you-name-it. His pursuit becomes our own, as we see our world through his bold eyes.""<br>
—Linda Chavez<br>
<br>
""The essay on O. J. Simpson is among the most sensible and incisive writing from the mountain of commentary thatthat unfortunate case has produced. Crouch remains one of our most formidable social and literary critics."" <br>
—Gerald Early<br>
<br>
<i>""Always in Pursuit</i> is everything I love about the brilliant Stanley Crouch. In his hands the essay becomes a great jazz riff on the page—social commentary rightly done as a singular 'I'. Written by a passionately determined believer in the American possibility, this collection of essays is wide ranging, fiercely opinionated, elegantly composed, purposefully challenging. Be prepared.""<br>

<p>Now Meryle Secrest -- biographer of Frank Lloyd Wright, Stephen Sondheim, and Leonard Bernstein -- brings her extraordinary skills to this full-scale life of Rodgers. She shows us for the first time the complexities of his nature, his emotional fault lines, and, most important, the wellsprings of his art.</p>
<p>She writes of his childhood and how he learned at an early age to mask his feelings, escaping into the world of operetta -- of Franz Lehar and Jerome Kern. She follows his close and wonderfully productive working relationship with Lorenz Hart -- a collaboration that resulted in more than thirty Broadway and West End musicals, including Babes in Arms and Pal Joey, but was ultimately undone by Hart's drinking. She evokes Rodgers's triumphant second collaboration, with the gifted -- and happily stable -- Oscar Hammerstein, which gave us Oklahoma!, Carousel, South Pacific, The King and I, and more. She explores Rodgers's own problems with alcohol as well as his periodic breakdowns; and she illuminates the deep-rooted tensions that underlay his forty-nine-year marriage to Dorothy Feiner.</p>
<p> Somewhere for Me is both a lively portrait of American musical theatre and a revelation of the brilliant, passionate, moody, and mercurial artist who was one of its greatest figures.</p>"
9780375401657,"A Third Face: My Tale Of Writing, Fighting, And Filmmaking",['Samuel Fuller'],"Winner of Best Non-Fiction for 2002 Award from the Los Angeles Times Book Review! Samuel Fuller was one of the most prolific and independent writer-director-producers in Hollywood. His 29 tough, gritty films made from 1949 to 1989 set out to capture the truth of war, racism and human frailties, and incorporate some of his own experiences. His film Park Row was inspired by his years in the New York newspaper business, where his beat included murders, suicides, state executions and race riots. He writes about hitchhiking across the country at the height of the Great Depression. His years in the army in World War II are captured in his hugely successful pictures The Big Red One, The Steel Helmet and Merrill's Marauders. Fuller's other films include Pickup on South Street; Underworld U.S.A., a movie that shows how gangsters in the 1960s were seen as ""respected"" tax-paying executives; Shock Corridor, which exposed the conditions in mental institutions; and White Dog, written in collaboration with Curtis Hanson (L.A. Confidential), a film so controversial that Paramount's then studio heads Jeffrey Katzenberg and Michael Eisner refused to release it. In addition to his work in film, Samuel Fuller (1911-1997) wrote eleven novels. He lived in Los Angeles with his wife and their daughter. A Third Face was completed by Jerome Henry Rudes, Fuller's longtime friend, and his wife, Christa Lang Fuller. ""Fuller wasn't one for tactful understatement and his hot-blooded, incident-packed autobiography is accordingly blunt ... A Third Face is a grand, lively, rambunctious memoir."" - Janet Maslin, The New York Times ""Fuller's last work is a joy and an important addition to film and popular culture literature."" - Publishers Weekly ""If you don't like the films of Sam Fuller, then you just don't like cinema."" - Martin Scorsese, from the book's introduction"

It is a birthright, Nancy Barr claims, that is passed down through generations of Italian families. She learned by watching how her grandmother, Nonna, prepared meals and it is this hands-on experience that she translates in the pages of this book -- ""a primer of techniques and taste that will become your Nonna in the kitchen."" 
<p>Most importantly, she features in careful detail a Primary recipe that demonstrates an essential technique: for example, Spaghetti and Marinara Sauce followed by countless variations like Bucatini with Amatrice (a pork flavored sauce), Perciatelli with Eggplant Sauce, Ziti with Sausages and Peppers, and finally a chart detailing proportions so you can create your own pasta dishes. A Primary recipe for saut éing Veal Scallopine with Lemon and Parsley is followed by variations using pork, chicken, and turkey, plus rolled, stuffed, and breaded versions. She takes the fear out of fish cookery by making us understand how to treat each different species. And vegetables, the pride of the Italian table, get their due by cooking them the way that is right for each variety.</p>
<p> The recipes are simple but the lessons learned are invaluable. Once you have absorbed the techniques offered here, you will have inherited the gift of Italian cooking and any dish you create -- or try from other books -- will have the genuine flavor of this timeless cuisine.</p>"

Newman'],"In <i>No Shame in My Game</i>, anthropologist Katherine Newman presents a view of inner-city poverty radically different from that commonly accepted. The all-too-prevalent picture we get of the poor today - in the media, in the political sphere, and in scholarly studies - is of alienated minorities living in big-city ghettos, lacking in values and family structure, criminally inclined, and permanently dependent on government handouts. What Newman reveals, however - as she focuses on the working poor in Harlem, one of the country's most depressed urban areas - is a community of people who are committed to earning a living, struggling to support themselves and their families on minimum-wage dead-end jobs, and clinging to the dignity of a regular paycheck, no matter how meager. For two years, Professor Newman and her assistants followed people in Harlem - from work to school to the streets to their homes - and spent hundreds of hours talking to employees, and their bosses and supervisors, their friends and families. From observations and interviews, we come to understand not only the essential contribution that low-wage earners make to the survival of poor households, but also the ways in which these jobs affect young people's attitudes, prospects, and self-image. Most powerfully, we listen as low-wage earners speak about their jobs, their ambitions, and their values - especially their devotion to family and belief in the work ethic.

<p>From the world-famous Swiss psychologist whose book <b>The Drama of the Gifted Child</b> has become a classic, here are seven ""life stories"" exploring the countless ways in which our families and our childhood experiences form us and turn us into the people we are today.</p>
<p>How do early experiences of love or suffering affect our adult relationships? What effect is child abuse likely to have on the victim's later life? How does hatred evolve and take root? How do people develop into cult leaders or political tyrants? Through the seven hypothetical scenarios and two essays that make up Paths of Life, Miller examines these questions and many others. Her narratives demonstrate that with knowledge and understanding of our past we have the power to change our future, freeing ourselves from the curse of repeating our parents' mistakes. In this, her eighth book, Alice Miller has given us yet another wise and profound study of the inestimable importance of childhood.</p>

Clearly an accomplished and important book, it is also a profoundly disturbing one.<br>
<br>
In a suburb of Bologna, three boys and two girls—ranging in age from ten to fifteen—enter the season of long summer days and the mysterious beauty of the cornfields surrounding the town. There, in an abandoned shack, they discover the excitement of being part of a group with its own rules and secrets. Normal kids who Rollerblade and play the same video games and Oasis and Alanis Morissette CDs that kids play everywhere, they come from normal families, their parents just as busy as most are these days. Although everyone assumes that someone will keep an eye on the kids—they're always playing out front in the parking lot, aren't they?—this assumption turns out to be false.<br>
<br>
Tiring of familiar childish pastimes, these five ride bikes or scooters out to their clubhouse and awkwardly begin their sexual initiation, liberated by innocence and driven by natural curiosity. But this rite of passage is gradually perverted by images from the adult world; as these increase in creepiness and violence, inevitably the games these confused and powerless children play, mimicking desires not their own, become horrifyingly real.<br>
<br>
Claustrophobic, mesmerizing and unflinching, <i>What We Don't Know About Children</i> is a brave exploration of eroticism and a harsh indictment of a society whose dark, disturbing aspects leave that most fragile, vulnerable blessing—childhood—forever atrisk."

<p>Brilliantly conceived and powerfully evoked, <b>Kafka's Curse</b> is a modern reinterpretation of the Arabic legend of the gardener who loves a princess and, for his transgression, is transformed into a tree. Reset in South Africa as apartheid was coming undone, this is the story of the Khan family, who are both ""colored"" and Muslim.&nbsp;&nbsp;When Oscar Khan, a budding architect, dares to pursue a woman outside his race and to change his religious identity, he commits a sin and must be punished. His unforgiving brother, a post-apartheid politician, tries to come to terms with Oscar's apostasy but will himself betray both his principles and his family when he falls in love with Amina, a beautiful and spirited psychotherapist.</p>
<p><b>Kafka's Curse</b> is both part of the tradition of politically charged South African fiction and a bold departure that makes us see that nation as we never have before. Imbued with a timely resonance even as it is narrated with the lyric and imagistic intensity of magic realism, it announces the arrival of Achmat Dangor in the forefront of contemporary literary novelists.</p>"

Anthony were two heroic women who vastly bettered the lives of a majority of American citizens. For more than fifty years they led the public battle to secure for women the most basic civil rights and helped establish a movement that would revolutionize American society. Yet despite the importance of their work and they impact they made on our history, a century and a half later, they have been almost forgotten.
<p>Stanton and Anthony were close friends, partners, and allies, but judging from their backgrounds they would seem an unlikely pair. Stanton was born into the prominent Livingston clan in New York, grew up wealthy, educated, and sociable, married and had a large family of her own. Anthony, raised in a devout Quaker environment, worked to support herself her whole life, elected to remain single, and devoted herself to progressive causes, initially Temperance, then Abolition. They were nearly total opposites in their personalities and attributes, yet complemented each other's strengths perfectly. Stanton was a gifted writer and radical thinker, full of fervor and radical ideas but pinned down by her reponsibilities as wife and mother, while Anthony, a tireless and single-minded tactician, was eager for action, undaunted by the terrible difficulties she faced. As Stanton put it, ""I forged the thunderbolts, she fired them.""</p>
<p>The relationship between these two extraordinary women and its effect on the development of the suffrage movement are richly depicted by Ward and Burns, and in the accompanying essays by Ellen Carol Dubois, Ann D. Gordon, and Martha Saxton. We also see Stanton and Anthony's interactions with major figures of the time, from Frederick Douglass and John Brown to Lucretia Mott and Victoria Woodhull. Enhanced by a wonderful array of black-and-white and color illustrations, <b>Not For Ourselves Alone</b> is a vivid and inspiring portrait of two of the most fascinating, and important, characters in American history.</p>"

A year later, thirty women signed the Virginia Military Institute's matriculation register, received their crew cuts, and spend their first night inside the barracks where in previous years even the mothers of new students were denied entry. In preparation for this remarkable transformation, VMI painstakingly examined every aspect of its culture: its facilities, dress code, haircuts, physical-fitness standards, and its hallowed traditions, such as the ratline - the grueling months of physical exertion, minimal sleep, and verbal harassment to which entering cadets are subjected. As a member of VMI's assimilation committee, Laura Fairchild Brodie is able to take us behind the scences, telling the story through the voices of the participants themselves - from concerned administrators to angry alumni, and from ambivalent male cadets to the determined female recruits. And in a new afterword to this edition, Brodie interviews members of the first co-ed class during their senior year, to find out how the four years of transition changed their lives.

Yet Edward Tenner shows that human ingenuity can be applied in self-preservation as well, and he sheds light on the ways in which the users of commonplace technology surprise designers and engineers, as when early typists developed the touch method still employed on todayâs keyboards. And he offers concrete advice for reaping benefits from the devices that we no longer seem able to live without. Although dependent on these objects, we can also use them to liberate ourselves. This delightful and instructive history of invention shows why National Public Radiodubbed Tenner 'the philosopher of everyday technology.' <p>Author Biography: Edward Tenner has been a visiting scholar in the Departments of Geosciences and English at Princeton University.

<p>Rebelling against the Elvis-based, American-imported rock scene in late '60s Brazil, Caetano Veloso suffused lyrical Brazilian folksongs with fuzz guitar, avant-jazz, and electronic music-and in doing so blew apart the status quo of Brazilian culture.</p>
<p>Caetano and the movement he catalyzed, <i>tropicalia</i>, urged an adoption of personal freedom in politics, music, and lifestyle. His ""rabble-rousing,"" as the government saw it, would get Caetano and his comrade Gilberto Gil arrested and exiled to London to wait out the military dictatorship. His fame increasing by the year, Caetano focused on writing songs about his homeland, returning to Brazil as a national hero-a mantle he still wears today. His most recent album, <i>Live in Bahia</i>, was released to international critical and popular acclaim.</p>

How our perceptions are our only internal map of the world, how there are places that claim you and places that warn you away. How you can fall in love with the light.<br>
<br>
 —Ellen Meloy</i><br>
<br>
Neurobiologists say that our sensitivity to color begins when we are infants. For artist-naturalist Ellen Meloy, who has spent most of her life in wild, remote places, an intoxication with light and color—sometimes subliminal, often fierce—has expressed itself as a profound attachment to landscape. It has been rightly said: Color is the first principle of Place.<br>
<br>
In this luminous mix of memoir, natural history, and eccentric adventure, Meloy uses turquoise—the color and the gem—as a metaphor for a way to make sense of the world from the clues of nature. From the Sierra Nevada, the Mojave Desert, the Yucatan Peninsula, and the Bahamas to her home ground on the high plateaus and in the deep canyons of the Southwest, we journey with Meloy through diverse habitats of supersensual light, through places of beauty and places of desecration. With keen vision and sharp wit she introduces us to deserts, canyons, turquoise seas, and ancestral mountains, as well as to comedian plants, psychiatrist mules, and Persians who consider turquoise the equivalent of a bulletproof vest. Meloy describes women held to the desert by sheer gravity, and she mourns the passing of her oldest neighbors, the Navajo “velvet grandmothers” whose attire and aestheticsabsorb the vivid palette of their homeland. There is a swim across the Mojave, a harrowing error on a solo trip down a wild river, and a birthday party with wild sheep.<br>
<br>
Throughout, Meloy invites us to appreciate along with her the environments, creatures, and objects that celebrate what we often take for granted: “our own spirits, the eternity of all things.”</p>"

""Our hero, Dimitri Borja Korozec, is born in the late 1800s to a Brazilian contortionist mother and a fanatically nationalist Serbian linotypist father. Dimitri enrolls in a training school for assassins, where he excels - except for his troubling propensity for fouling things up at the last moment. Part Carlos the Jackal, part Woody Allen's Zelig, part Inspector Clouseau, and part Forrest Gump, Dimitri is a schlemiel of an assassin and anarchist who can't seem to kill anyone. He does, however, cause enough mayhem to help start World War I, spread Spanish influenza to the American continent, and unintentionally trigger various other significant events of the twentieth century by slipping and falling, misreading signs, and misunderstanding instructions."" ""Along the way Dimitri runs into - and, sometimes, nearly over - a diverse cast of bit players: Mata Hari, Al Capone, Carmen Miranda, Marie Curie, Pablo Picasso, Jean Cocteau, Irving Thalberg, George Raft, and even Aleister Crowley make their appearances.

<br>
Impassioned participant in and acute observer of the life of his times, Alvin Josephy takes us from the New York of the teens and twenties to the 1990s on the Oregon ranch where he has found his heart's home. His ""walk"" leads him to Harvard during the hopeful days of the New Deal; to scriptwriting for MGM in Hollywood and menial work on Wall Street in the Depression; through a job with the Herald Tribune (for which he interviewed Leon Trotsky); to the wartime landings on Iwo Jima and Guam, which he covered as a Marine Corps combat correspondent; to an antiwar march with Martin Luther King, Jr.; to his profound involvement in Native American and environmental causes.<br>
<br>
Josephy tells how it was that he found his true calling — becoming an advocate for American Indians and the land they once called their own. In a wonderful way, he gives witness to two Americas: He renders the excitement of the go-go industrial expansionist nation that came into being in the first half of the century and burst onto the world after the war. At the same time he chronicles our growing awareness of another America — the land and people who had no voice as the country around them grew.<br>
<br>
His astute understanding of the events he witnessed and became part of, and the spirited, evocative quality of his narrative, combine to capture the life, the turmoil, the problems, progress, setbacks, and satisfactions, of this American Century.<br>
<br>
<i>A Walk Toward Oregon</i> will move and delight readers who havelived these years themselves, as well as the young who want to know firsthand what came before them. It will stand as an indispensable document of our time."
9780375409127,A Big Life In Advertising,['Mary Wells Lawrence'],"One of advertising’s all-time greats, Mary Wells Lawrence, shows us the American ad world from the 1950s through the 1980s in all its brilliance, excitement, fun and craziness.<br>
<br>
She captures the thrill of being a young copywriter in the 1960s at Doyle Dane Bernbach, working for the dazzling, revolutionary Bill Bernbach (“There was something volcanic [about him] . . . a little like being in the company of Mao or Che or the young Fidel”); how he took on a car rental firm that barely existed, announced to the world it was Number Two and therefore it tried harder—and overnight made the unknown Avis second only to the mighty Hertz; how Bernbach’s “Think Small” campaign made big car–obsessed America fall in love with the unlikely Volkswagen; how his Polaroid ads explained the mysterious instant camera to the public without saying a word.<br>
<br>
She writes about leaving Doyle Dane Bernbach (for seven years her Heaven on earth) for a new ad company, and how she made it her own, producing the simple and unforgettable “Plop Plop Fizz Fizz” Alka-Seltzer commercial by getting rid of the cartoon tablet, Speedy, and creating a frothy, luminous commercial composed of nothing but two Alka-Seltzers dropping into a crystal glass of water; how she gave Braniff Airways brilliant visibility by painting its airplanes fresh, vivid colors—and then fell in love with and married the head of the company.<br>
<br>
She writes about her campaign for the French tourist bureau and how she used a single image—a country man on a bicycle—that today is still the symbol of France’s rural life . . . how she traveled the world for BettyCrocker’s casserole dishes, how she brought theatricality and fantasy to TV advertising.<br>
<br>
She tells how she started Wells Rich Greene and ran it like a movie studio. She writes about the clients and the campaigns . . . how she created a new line of cosmetics—Love—for a conservative drug company (it became one of the most successful cosmetics launches in history) . . . how she helped save American Motors from bankruptcy, redesigned its cars and put together an ad campaign that did the unthinkable—compared its unknown Javelin with Ford’s beloved Mustang . . . how Midas was “Midasized”. . . how, when thousands of Ford dealers had gone out of business, the Ford ads focused <br>
not on Ford’s cars but on the dedication of its workers, with the slogan “Quality is Job One”; how she made New York the place to be when it was seen as a sinking ship, with the slogan “I Love New York.”<br>
<br>
She writes about taking Wells Rich Greene public and how she became the first woman CEO of a company on the New York Stock Exchange . . . how she made a movie with the last of the Hollywood moguls, Jack Warner. She tells how she transformed a dilapidated, once-famous villa, La Fiorentina, at Cap Ferrat (a Nazi stronghold during the war) into a Mediterranean Eden, and writes about her battle with cancer. She talks about her refusal to globalize Wells Rich Greene and her decision, finally, to sell the company she’d built into the fastest-growing ad agency in history, and what happened to it afterward.<br>
<br>
Here is the extraordinary story of how Mary Wells Lawrence lived her life in advertising—helped shape her profession, was shaped by it and left her mark on it."

But Maxwell, who is black, finds himself increasingly at odds with the notion of lifelong togetherness with a white woman, as he yields to group pressure.

But what ultimately sanctified the national jubilee in the minds of the celebrants was an extraordinary coincidence: the nearly simultaneous deaths of Thomas Jefferson and John Adams, the last pillars of the original republic, already venerated as legends in their own time. It was a watershed in the nation's history, a bright moment when the successors to the Revolutionary dream examined their own lives as they took inspiration from and found nostalgia in the accomplishments of the founders.<br>
<br>
In this fascinating book, the distinguished historian Andrew Burstein explores what it was to be an American in 1826. Drawing on private diaries and letters, daily newspapers, and long-buried publications, he shows us the personal lives behind the pageantry and reveals an acutely self-conscious nation–anxiously optimistic about its future, eager to romanticize the Revolutionary past.<br>
<br>
We follow the Marquis de Lafayette, the only surviving general of the War of Independence, on his triumphant 1825 tour of all twenty-four states. We visit an Ohio boomtown on the edge of the ""new West,"" a region influenced by the Erie Canal and the commercialism that canal culture brought with it. We see through the eyes of ordinary citizens–the wife of a Massachusetts minister, the author of a popular novel of the day, the family of a prominent statesman–and learn about their gritty understanding of life and death, the nuances of contemporary sexual politics, and the sometimes treacherous drama of public debate. And we meet headline-makers such as the orneryPresident John Quincy Adams, the controversial Secretary of State Henry Clay, and the notoriously hot-tempered General Andrew Jackson, struggling to act in a statesmanlike way as he waits to be swept into the White House.<br>
<br>
In this evocative portrait of the United States in its jubilee year, Burstein shows how 1826 marked an unforgettable time in the republic's history, when a generation embraced the legacy of its predecessors and sought to enlarge its role in America's story."

Having survived the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989, he now became the focus of a massive pursuit as one of the regime's five most wanted ""criminals,"" and was smuggled out of China, leaving behind his wife, Fu Li, and their young son. After two long years and great international pressure, the family was finally reunited in Princeton, New Jersey. For a brief time, it seemed as if the worst was behind them. But on June 4, 1993 -- exactly four years after Tiananmen -- while the family was being driven to Niagara Falls, the car they were in sped off the road. When Su Xiaokang regained consciousness, he discovered that Fu Li was in a coma, from which she would eventually emerge unable to speak or to control her limbs."

James Houston takes us inside this central American myth in a compelling new way that only a novelist can achieve. 
<p>The people whose dreams, courage, terror, ingenuity, and fate we share are James Frazier Reed, one of the leaders of the Donner Party, and his wife and four children--in particular his eight-year-old daughter, Patty. From the moment we meet Reed--proud, headstrong, yet a devoted husband and father--traveling with his family in the ""Palace Car,"" a huge, specially built covered wagon transporting the Reeds in grand style, the stage is set for trouble. And as they journey across the country, thrilling to new sights and new friends, coping with outbursts of conflict and constant danger, trouble comes. It comes in the fateful choice of a wrong route, which causes the group to arrive at the foot of the Sierra Nevada too late to cross into the promised land before the snows block the way. It comes in the sudden fight between Reed and a drover--a fight that exiles Reed from the others, sending him solo over the mountains ahead of the storms.</p>
<p>We follow Reed during the next five months as he travels around northern California, trying desperately to find means and men to rescue his family. And through the amazingly imagined ""Trail Notes"" of Patty Reed, who recollects late in life her experiences as a child, we also follow the main group, progressively stranded and starving on the Nevada side of the Sierras.</p>
<p><i>Snow Mountain Passage</i> is an extraordinary tale of pride and redemption. What happens--who dies, who survives, and why--is brilliantly, grippingly told.<br>

9780375411045,Breathing Room: Poems,['Peter Davison'],"“Peter Davison, for years, has pondered with clear insight the perspectives of affection, attachment, loss, and memory, his language spare and his tone classical and deceptively quiet. The poems of this new collection look at the same world with surprise and speak of it with a startled and startling freedom, feeling ‘entitled to the liberty of breathing easy’—a freedom that brings with it the old clarity and eloquence.”<br>
—W. S. Merwin<br>
<br>
The poems in Peter Davison’s exuberant new collection contemplate the paradox of growing old—of having a mind still “a juicy swamp of invention” in a body beginning to falter.<br>
<br>
Both intimate and generous, these poems celebrate the cycle of the seasons, of death and rebirth: snapping turtles lay their eggs and new ones hatch; a ruffed grouse drums his spring mating dance. Memory is central: a mother’s lost face; a father’s voice that “plumbed the marrow of poetry as tenderly / as if a darling had crept into his arms”; a wife’s “rueful eyes, cornflower blue.” And the poet pays tribute to the literary life—to reading, to the precise moment a word rises to consciousness, to getting over Robert Frost, to the mind of Sylvia Plath. <br>
These are poems that expand time for us and deepen place, whether Davison is taking us on a path along a limestone cliff under canopies of holly and ivy, or is revisiting the instant while recovering from surgery when it becomes clear he is going to heal. “To learn poetry,” Davison writes in his foreword, “we need to take poems into our breath and blood, and that requires us to hear themas we read them, to learn to read with all the senses, especially with the ear.” <i>Breathing Room</i> gives us a splendid array of poems that we want to read with all our senses."

Some of the letters were written in code, which di Robilant and his father cracked to reveal an illicit passion: Giustiniana was not of the elite ruling class and would never have been considered a suitable match for Andrea. But their acts of devotion were startlingly brazen. As their courtship unfolds, they plot elaborate marriage schemes that offend everyone, arrange secret trysts in borrowed rooms, cause trouble for the servants who must ferry their forbidden correspondence, and even weather an unwanted pregnancy, from which Giustiniana, with her wits and ingenuity and some crucial assistance from the infamous Casanova, emerges unscathed.<p>Andrea di Robilant, heir to the lovers' legacy, captures them in the twilight of the golden era of Venice, with forays to the colorful social circles of London and Paris along the way. His narrative evokes the world of mask-wearing men and ladies attending Goldini plays and gambling at the Ridotto - bringing to life, 250 years later, a tale of passion and historical intrigue.</p>"

<p>Centering on five pilots of the renowned Kosciuszko Squadron, the authors show how the fliers, driven by their passionate desire to liberate their homeland, came to be counted among the most heroic and successful fighter pilots of World War II. Drawing on the Kosciuszko Squadron’s unofficial diary–filled with the fliers’ personal experiences in combat–and on letters, interviews, memoirs, histories, and photographs, the authors bring the men and battles of the squadron vividly to life. We follow the principal characters from their training before the war, through their hair-raising escape from Poland to France and then, after the fall of France, to Britain. We see how, first treated with disdain by the RAF, the Polish pilots played a crucial role during the Battle of Britain, where their daredevil skill in engaging German Messerschmitts in close and deadly combat while protecting the planes in their own groups soon made them legendary. And we learn what happened to them after the war, when their country was abandoned and handed over to the Soviet Union.<br>
<i><br>
</i><b>A Question of Honor</b> also gives us a revelatory history of Poland during World War II and of the many thousands in the Polish armed forces who fought with the Allies. It tells of the country’s unending struggle against both Hitler and Stalin, its long battle for independence, and the tragic collapse of that dream in the “peace” that followed. Powerful, moving, deeply involving, <i>A Question of Honor</i> is an important addition to the literature of World War II.</p>"
9780375412066,"Soldiers: Fighting Men's Lives, 1901-2001",['Philip Ziegler'],"A fascinating in-depth study of the character and spirit of soldiers.<br>
<br>
Rich in narrative and anecdote, this involving, poignant book takes as its starting point interviews with Chelsea Pensioners, who saw action from the First World War to Korea, and whose lives in the army span the 20th century. Ziegler is intrigued by the values the veterans share, which he believes the army must have instilled in them -- self-discipline, acceptance of risk and pain, patriotism, and solidarity with their fellow soldiers.<br>
<br>
But he also acknowledges the bigotry, narrow-mindedness and even blinkered stupidity that are part of a soldier’s life. Above all, he celebrates the lives and attitudes of soldiers, and comes to an understanding of the world that means so much to them."

<p>In New York City, famous for its food and restaurants, locals are reverential about the bakeshop and café Once Upon a Tart. For more than a decade, they have been lining up at the store mornings and afternoons, waiting patiently for their signature scones, muffins, soups, salads, sandwiches, cookies, and—of course—tarts. And pretty much since the day the café opened, patrons have been asking—sometimes begging—the proprietors for their sweet and savory recipes. Good news: the wait is over.</p>
<p>In <b>Once Upon a Tart</b>, the café’s founders and co-owners, Jerome Audureau (a New Yorker via France) and Frank Mentesana (a New Yorker via New Jersey), go public with their culinary secrets (“We don’t have any,” says Frank. “That’s our biggest secret of all”) and recipes. They also tell their inspiring success story, from selling tarts wholesale out of a warehouse in Long Island City to opening their now-famous outpost in Soho.</p>
<p>In nine delicious chapters ranging from savory tarts to cookies, the authors instruct and advise home cooks on everything from how to make the flakiest tart crust (“keep the dough cold”) to making sandwiches (“condiments are key”) to how to diet (“you want half the calories, eat half the scone”). <b>Once Upon a Tart</b> is packed with more than 225 easy-to-prepare recipes, including all the store classics that have earned Frank and Jerome the devotion of their customers: Caramelized-Leek-and-Celery Tart, Creamy Carrot Soup with Fresh Dill, Pork Loin Sandwich with Frisée and Rosemary-Garlic Aioli, Buttermilk Scones with Dried Currants, Banana–Poppy Seed Muffins, and Strawberry-Rhubarb Tart with Crisp Topping.</p>
<p>Says Frank, “We believe that deep down, everyone is a cook.” Adds Jerome, “And that a little butter in your life is a good thing.”</p>"

As a production assistant, or gofer, he found himself front row center at the creation of one of the greatest of all Broadway musicals: Follies. Now, more than thirty years later, he has fashioned that eyewitness account into an extraordinary chronicle that sheds new light on a still-evolving art form while capturing an era long gone.
<p>Everything Was Possible takes the reader on the roller-coaster ride that is the musical-making process, from the uncertainties of casting to drama-filled rehearsals, from the care and feeding of one-time movie stars like Alexis Smith and Yvonne De Carlo to the tension of that first performance, from the pressures of an out-of-town tryout to the exhilaration of opening night on Broadway.</p>"

9780375414398,Monturiol's Dream: The Extraordinary Story Of The Submarine Inventor Who Wanted To Save The World,['Matthew Stewart'],"A marvelous rediscovery: the compelling story of the strange and noble life--and dream--of nineteenth-century utopian social revolutionary and self-taught engineer Narcis Monturiol, who invented the world's first fully operational steam-powered submarine, not as a weapon of war but as a means of saving human life and spreading democracy.<br>
Matthew Stewart tells the story of Monturiol from his childhood to his years living the dangerous life of a revolutionary. We see him at the bloody barricades and fleeing--one step ahead of the Barcelona police--to the remote coastline of northern Catalonia. On that shore, watching teams of divers risk their lives gathering coral from the water's depths for use in the making of jewels, candelabras, and crimson pigment, he finds the true purpose of his life. He saves a man presumed dead from drowning and conceives of a craft that will protect the divers who harvest coral--a safe, hermetically sealed underwater vessel that will make the ocean's bounty available to the common man.
<p>Stewart writes about the building of Monturiol's submarine: how, without scientific education (he was a lawyer by training), Monturiol read books on physics, chemistry, and biology; how he launched a hand-powered prototype submarine capable of reaching depths of sixty feet; how his efforts to gain government support for building a larger submarine were thwarted (his invention was dismissed by one official as having ""no useful applications""). We see Monturiol, unwilling to give up on his dream, turn to the artists, poets, and musicians of Barcelona to help him mobilize the public to fund his project, and how he launched his second, much larger vessel five years later: themost advanced submarine of its day; at more than fifty feet long it displaced seventy-two tons and navigated reliably at depths of up to one hundred feet, with a unique system for eliminating carbon dioxide, replenishing oxygen in the interior cabin, and enabling its crew to remain underwater indefinitely. It had a steam engine for propulsion, a chemical furnace to heat the engine as it generated oxygen for the crew, external lights, portholes, and pincers for harvesting coral and other objects from the deep. It was the first true submarine; the world would not see its equal for another twenty years.</p>
<p>And we watch as Monturiol's revolutionary friends, making use of his utopian ideals and notions of urban planning (a term he originated), forge a new culture for Catalonia and its capital city and create the radical design that resulted in an entirely new Barcelona.</p>"
