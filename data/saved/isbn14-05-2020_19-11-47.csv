Among her colleagues at Oxford University, Dr. Marion Manning is considered a brilliant scholar and an extraordinary woman.

Except for Joyo, the flamboyant character who shares her home as a housekeeper-companion, the respected don leads a solitary life, contentedly pursuing her studies.

9.78037E+12,Confessions Of An Ex-girlfriend,['Lynda Curnyn'],"Ex-Girlfriend Emma Carter has a lot on her mind. Her boyfriend got a life — in L.A. Her hairdresser found God. And that extra ten pounds of ""relationship flab"" she acquired while falling in love with a commitmentphobe has just put her out of the running for new romance — or so she thinks. But before Emma can get on with her life, she's got to face a few startling truths about being single in New York City . . . <br>
<br>
<p>Confession #5: Marriage suddenly seems like a social disease.<br>
<i>Even the latest bride in my family — my mother — has put me to work in the service of her wedding day. What about us non-bride-to-be's? I wonder now. Working in the warped little world of wedding planning has only led me to one conclusion: If you don't get married in this world, you get nothing. Once, in an editorial meeting, I jokingly suggested that a woman should get a bridal shower when she turns thirty, wedding or not. Everyone looked at me as if I were some kind of nut. I am 31 years old; am I not entitled to free Calphalon yet?</i><br>
</p>
<p>Whoever thought that baring your soul could be this good?</p>
<p><b>Lynda Curnyn</b> will only confess to being under 35 <i>and</i> under the illusion that it is better to have loved and binged than never to have loved (or binged) at all. She writes, edits, lives, and loves in New York City.</p>"

9.78037E+12,A Vintage Year For Dying (a Hugh Morrison Mystery),['Frank Orenstein'],"Florene Beasley claims her professor husband is dead, and while this fails to bother her, collecting on his insurance is hard to do without a body. Hugh Morrison, an aging, retired state trooper, declines the chance to dust off his investigating skills, preferring a quiet life made exciting only by rich, fattening foods. Harriet, his elderly lady friend, overrules him; work will keep him young, light snacks will keep him healthy. (Hugh lives over Harriet's garage, and the smalltown gossips of Appleboro wonder about those two.). Reluctantly, Hugh tackles the problem, and with Harriet at his side he follows a twisted path through multiple murders, drug deals, academic infighting, sabotage of vintage wines, and the case of an underfed and oversexed Siamese cat. Through it all, he dreams wistfully of thick steaks, hot fudge sundaes, and an absence of work. A Vintage Year for Dying is a wonderfully twisty whodunit with warm, lovable characters caught up in a web of betrayal, greed, and murder.

                        <p>Florene Beasley insists that her husband is not just missing--he's dead, and asks retired state trooper and self-styled curmudgeon Hugh Morrison to find the body so she can collect on the insurance.

9.78037E+12,Writers Of The Purple Sage,['Barbara Burnett Smith'],"Judge Volney Osler was a respected, well-liked resident of Purple Sage, Texas - or at least that's what most people thought, right up to the day he was murdered. Unfortunately for aspiring writer Jolie Wyatt, the murder was an exact copy of one she had outlined in her novel-in-progress. And who should have fought with the judge right in the middle of town the day before but Jolie? Eager to deflect suspicion from herself, Jolie, a relative newcomer to the small town, begins to investigate, focusing reluctantly on the members of her writing group and the assistant chief of police, all of whom had access to her manuscript and knew about her unusual murder method. In the meantime, she still has to contend with a typically contrary teenaged son, her continuing job search, and confusion over her relationship with her ex-husband, rancher Matt Wyatt. A small town keeps its secrets close, but Jolie perseveres in digging, only to discover more than a few people with reason to kill the judge - and maybe herself as well. With humor and flair, first-time novelist Barbara Burnett Smith has introduced an engaging new sleuth, and readers will applaud the appearance of smart, sassy Jolie Wyatt."
9.78037E+12,Larkspur,['Sheila Simonson'],"Lark Dailey faces a weekend at the mountain lodge of her mother's mentor, poet Dai Llewellyn, without enthusiasm, but Lark's detective-lover Jay finds the proximity of a notorious pot-farm interesting. The setting, a remote Sierra lake, is idyllic, perfect for canoeing and wind-surfing, not to mention fireworks. Neither Lark nor Jay expects the Fourth of July to end in murder. Surrounded by old friends, ex-lovers, devoted servants--and someone who does not love him--the poet collapses. He has been poisoned by tincture of larkspur in his Campari. The irony is not lost on Lark, whose bookstore is called Larkspur Books, nor on Jay, who is tapped to investigate. Jay's investigation is complicated by the murder of two key witnesses and by bizarre embellishments in all three killings. The embellishments suggest that something less straightforward than greed is driving the killer, something like madness. The tangle of suspicion widens to include not only the poet's weekend guests but even Lark's charming, book-loving clerk. Lark worries that her mother, who comes to town after the San Francisco funeral, may be in danger too, because someone does not like poets, and Mary Dailey, a noted poet, is Llewellyn's literary executor. Her co-executor may have his own reasons for wanting to control the relics of Dai Llewellyn's past. As Jay awaits a search warrant, a cocktail party of survivors gathers to honor Lark's mother, and Lark determines to crash it in time to prevent another poisoning. Unfortunately, she's not sure who the murderer is."
